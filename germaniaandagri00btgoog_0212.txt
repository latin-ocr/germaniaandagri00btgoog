cess 00 ajudge when he came to preside in a civil tribunal. The
allusion here is to the conventus juridici, or circuit courts (assises),

, 10 which Agricola, as governor 01 the province, was now called ιο

preside. (Gronov, 010000.,111.,2214030100. The term togati is
here equivalent, in effect, ιο litigantes,· ior suits could only be carried
on in the toga, and in Latin. It does not mean lawyers or advo·
cates alone, or citizens merely iu opposition to soldievs. (Compare
Walclr, ad loc.)

Jam vero. “From this time, indeed.’‘—Conaentus “The cir·

province. was divided into a number 01 districts or circuits‚ each 01
which was called conventus, forum, or jurisdictio. At these conventus

litigant parties applied ιο the proconsul, or governor, who presided
in them, and this officer selected 0 number 01 judges, from the per·
sous assembled, ιο try their causes. The proconsul pronounced seu·
tenos according ιο the views 01 the judges, who were his assessore
or counsel. (Dict. Ant, s. vrb-Officio. “The claims 01 official

01 disposition, nor asperity 01 manners, but the sternness which be·

rogantia, as here employed, we are to understand, not the assump-
tion of what does not belong to a person, but the rigid exactiori 01
011 the respect and attention to which he has a claim. The term
ovantia has here its ordinary meaning. Agricola was not naturally

avarus, any more than he was tristis or arrogem,- but he was
Ι obliged to comply with the commanda 01 Vespasian, who was likely
enough to replenish his exhausted coffers by exactione from this
wealthy province. (CompareHist.,ii.,84; Suet, Vesp, 16.) Aac·
