Sciw. A powerful German tribe, who, according 1ο Tacitus,
possessed all the land t'rom the bauks of the Danube northward 10
the Baltic Sea, between the Elbo aud the Vistula. Th10ugh the
midst oi their territories stretched a chain ot* mountaius, the name
ot' which we do'not leam nom Tacitus (c. 43) ; but which, from his
¹ description, appears to he identical with the Asciburgiau range os
Ptolemy, and the modern'liiese'agebirge. Cesar makes their pos· ’
sessione extend to the Rhiue, along the north bank ot' the Moenus, “
οι· Maio. The reason os this was probably owing to the lact, that
00 the north side os the Maia an army oi Suevl bad come to the
aid of Ariovistus, which allerward retired (Cas, B. G, 1., ³7, 54,
ivl, 1-3). The catti were the tribe to which Caesar gave the name
01 Suevi. Strabo even speaks cs Sueri cu the Rhiue, when all
⁴ the tribes in that quanter had already become known through the
expeditione os the Romans (annal, 1., 41ς 11, 26, 44. Agr.. 28.
Ptol.. ii.. ll). The different nations into which the suevi were di·
rided arc enumerated by Tacitus (c. 38-45). Alter the time os
Tacitus, the name seems to have been nearly lost. lt appears only
once in the war with the Marcomanni, although that was carried on
against tribes who once burethe name. Alter this, it only occurs
twice. Ptolemy gives it asa surname to the Langobardi, and in
the fourth century appeared a people bearing the name, who dwelt
io the country called from thern Suelio. The name probably oc-
curs, though somewhat disguised, in that os the Viadrus, which
seeum originally to have began with an s.- the mouth still bears the
name os Swinemund. lustances os the loss os meletiana, and the
interchange osv and d, are seen in ἡδύς, aweet, suom, 00αάιο (orig-
inally to sweeteu), sap-or, ὕπνος, clavia claudo, dcc. Ptolemy speaks
ot a river suevus between the Oder and the Ehe,- but there is no
river there ol a magnitude approaching to that which hc assigna 1ο
the Suevus. Perhaps it was a name os the Oder, which he applied
to another river. Suiones appears to be only a variation oi the name
