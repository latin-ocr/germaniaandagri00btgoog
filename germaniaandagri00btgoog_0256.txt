ror, were now, however, entangled among the crowded bando of
the enemy, and the inequalities of the ground.’‘ Observe that by
hortium are here meant the Britons themselves, not, as Walther and
others suppose, the Romans. On retreating to their own infantry,
the charioteers, who had occasioned some consternation by their
first ebech, now became of little, if any, service3 for the crowded
barrds of their own countrymen, already thrown into confusion by
the charge of the Batavians and Tungri, as weil as the inequalities

cavalry usually presents; for, keeping their footing with difficulty
on the declivity, they were every moment either impeiied down·
