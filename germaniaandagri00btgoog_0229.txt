The subjunctive has not untrequently a pregnant sense, involviug
paese, aelle, opus eree. The reason why Tacitus expressed himself
on this occasion so cautiously may probably be owing to the laet
that Frontinus was still alive. In Hire, iv, ⁷13 v., 21, he uses
greater fresiam-Alterius. The term alter, although it is com· Ι

wild mountain tribes had not yet been accomplished, is showu‘not
only by Frontinus’s expedition, but by Agricola’s enterprise against '
Mona.
