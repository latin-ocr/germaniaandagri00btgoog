morum, or Boibemum, probably means, “the horne ot tha Boii”
(heim, heimath). Some, however, suppose that by Boiemam is
meant what Cesar calls oppidum Boiorum (B. G, vii, 9) in Gallia,
now Beoujolois ......... c. ts, 42

Banoriiu. (Called Βουσάκτεροι by Ptolemy.) A German tribe,
who, in all their wars with the Romans, never changed their seats.
Toward the west, they reached to the Veclt, toward the south, to
the Lippe; toward the east, almost to the Weserr and toward the
north, they bordered on the Frisii and Cauci. Along the Lippa,
their territorias extended probably from Lipprtadt to Hatram (Strabo,
vii, p. 291) ; aud that they reached eastward at least as sar as Lipp
stadt, we gather from Tacitus. (Ano, i., dd.) For some time,
while the Romans were superior in this quarter, they seem to hare
retired from the Lippe ; but they afterward returned. The Bructeri
were divided into the Bructeri Majores, who dwelt on the east, and
the Bructeri Minores, who dwelt on the west os the Amisia, or Bou.
They remained iu their old settlements till the Cherusci, under the
common name ot' Franks, united all the tribes os this part into one
league, and heneesorth we find them on the banhs os the Rhine.
Toward the end os the first century, they were subdusd by the Cham-
avi and Angrivarii, and, according to Tacitus, extirpated. But in
this he is most probably mistaken; sor we find the Roman com-
mander, Spurinna, engaged with them in the reign os Trajan ; and
in later times they appear as a powersul people among the Franks.
Their name was finally lost when they were orerpowered hythe
Saxone. It appears sor the last time in a letter oi Pope Gregory
111, about the year 720, where they are called Borthori. Their prin·
cipal towns were Osnabruga, Μεδιολάνιον (Macelo), Βογάόιον (Βο-
oholt), and Στερεόντιον (Steinsurt). (Eumeuii Pomp. Cenat. dict,

Buar. A German tribe living near the sources oi the Viadrus

(Odor) and Vistula, and extending astar as Briga and Crocon, or
near to Troppou, in Silrrie. lti conjunctior, lirst with the Daci, and
allerward with the Marcomanni, they waged war with Trajan, M.
Aurelius, and Commodus. (Dio Coss, lxviii, 8; Id, lxxi, 18 ; Iu,
