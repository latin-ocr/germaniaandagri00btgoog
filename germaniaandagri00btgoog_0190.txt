vious clause, namely, otiose perro armatorum, dre, the reason is
given why arms are not allowed to all without distinction; and now

Trans Scimus alind mare, oc. “ Beyoud the Suiones is another
sea, sluggish and almost without any motion,” i. e, on account of
tbe ice. (Compare agric, lap-Hinc. “From the following cir-

“Because the last brightness of the now setting sun continues so
vivid, until its rising, as to obscure the stars.” Compare Agra,
12. “Dicrum spatia ultro nothi orbis masuram,” dre. In the age
os Pliny and Tacitus the globular form os the earth was well known.
(Compare Ptin, ii., 64.) And Tacitus considered the earth, though
not completely spherieal‚ as a globe at rest in the centro of the uni·
verse, with the land completely surrounded by water, as Pliny
(it, 66) says: “ Est igitur inloto globo tellus medio ambitu precinctu
circumfluo mnri.'’ (Compare, also, Ptin.. ii, 70, 75.) The part os tbe
earth from Britain to the pole Tacitus conceived to be datter than
that from ltaly tc Britain, since there was no chain os mountains at
all to be compared to the Alps ; aud hence he talhs of the exactae et

shadow os the earth (Ptin, ii.,1o) rising in the formos a cone, ‚
since the body illumined is less than the body that illumines it, the
notion entertained by Tacitus is, that at the time os the solstlce,
when the sun approaches nearer the pole (Ptin, ii, 75), and ac·
eordingly dces not sink sar below the hennon, the shadowcs the
flatter parts os the earth toward the pole can not shroud the whole
heavens in darkness (extremo et plana terrarum noo erigunt tenebras),
but the surseee os the earth only is darkened, while the sky and
stars appear above the shadow, and are illumined by the rays os the
sun (infra celum et sidero not cadit, Agric, 12).

the sun bissing as he sinhs into the ocean, which, however, was
the vulgar belief (compare Strabo, iil, p. 138; Juc, xiv, 280), but
that produced hythe Aurora Borealis; and the sorores deorumst
radios capitis refer lihewise to the fanciful shapes assumed by these
electrical phenomena. To this source, perhaps, may be traced tho
