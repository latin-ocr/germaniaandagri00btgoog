With illc, supply regione. Drusus, Tiberius, and Germanicus ea·
plored this sea. Drusus is said to have penetrated also into the
Sinus Dollarius, attha mouth ol the Amisia, or Eme. Tiberius nav·
igated the Albis, or Elbo. The sbipwrcck os the fleet os Germanicus
proved likcwise a source of discovery, and, according to Mannert
(Geogr, iii, p. 91), pointed out to navigatore the way to the Baltic.

Herculia columnae. Resides the well-known Pillare ol Hercules
at the Straits oi Gibraltar, the ancient writers speak assimiler ones
in the north 3 a tradition which arose, in all probability, from the ex·
isteuce os similar natural features in that quarter. Where, how-
ever, the northern promontories were that received this name bas
never been satisfactorily ascertained. lt is generally supposed,

Drusus was the sou ol Tiberius-Mox cento tentarit. Editors gen-
erally interpret thie aa meaning that no one alter Drusus ventured
upon this sea, and, accordingly, are puaaled to reconcile this with
what Tacitus says in his Annals (ii, 6, 23, 24). This arises lrom
misunderstanding tbe meaning os mox, which, so far from signily-
ing thatun one sailed on this sea aller Drusus, implies that some
one did so, but that the expeditione of the Romans in this quarter
were soon abandoned. The other sense would require postea.

&arctiusque oe reverentiae, dre. “And it seemed mure picus aud
reverential to entertain a belief concamiug the actione of the gods,
than to seek tc become actually acquainted with them‚” i. ι, to
believe'in the present instance that Hercules actually visited the
north, aud that pillars erected by him do really exist in this quarter,
than to seek to ascertain their precise position.
