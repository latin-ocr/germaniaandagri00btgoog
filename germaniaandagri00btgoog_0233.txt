agebat. This omission of the verb agere or facere is not unfrequsnt
compare Ana, i., ta: “ Melius clementius itte, qui serrum milri obtu-
iit‚'' scil. agebat ,- and ir, 38: “Melius Augentum qui masei?
scil. egisse, dic-Non milites odsdrc. “ He promoted no recruits (to
the ranlts of the legion).” Tacitus is speaking here not of levying
soldicrs, but of the promotion of recmits to the honor of servingin
the legion through private favor (studiis poesim), or on the recom-
mendation of the centurione. The term militer in its full force he·
longed only to the legionary troops. The tirones thought much of
the honor of serring in the legion, and frequently importuned the
centurionsforthispromotion. Thepmdenceongricolaaccording·
ly, provided against what occurred in aiter times, as we leam from
vegetius: “ Legionm omnes in secroto permanet hodieque, sed per
negligentiam superiorum temporum robur infractum est, cum virtutis
mamis occuparet ambitio, et per gratiam promoverentur milites, qm
prornoeeri coruucrant per lahorem.” (Veget, iii, 3.)

Sed optimum quemque, duc. ‘⁴ But he thought each best man tho
most faithful.” Observe that optimos labere, in fact, equivalent to
fortissimus. Compare Sallust (Jog, 98); “Optimosqoisquecadere.”
-Omnio scire, ooo omnio exsequi. ‘¹ He knew all things, he did not
punish all.” Obserre that sesequi, in the sense of alcisci, is found
not only ln writers of this age, but in Livy, iii, 25, and v, ll. This
meaning is deduced naturally enough from the literal signification
of “to follow out.’‘

Gommodorc. ⁴· He applied.” There is no need, as Walther cor·
rectly remarks, of regarding this, with Walch, as an instance of
zeugma. The meaning we have here given to the verb, and which
is closely allied to its literal one, will suit equally well both senmm
and severitatem—Nec prena semper, esd sapies, dec. “Nor was he
satisfied (only) with punishment always, but mors frequently with
repentance.” Tbere is no need whatever of our supplying uti with
pono, as Ernesti does. Cicero has supplicio rossontus (in Vm,
ii.. 37), and we need not obJect, therefore, to pono contentus in the
present instance.

Frumenti et tributorum auctionem, dec. “He mitigated the in·
crease of the supply of corn and of the taxes by an equalizing of
burdens,'’ i. e, he took care that all the inhabitants should be rated
fairly, according to their property; that the poor might not have to
contribule more than the rich. ln the term mista Tacitus refers
to poll-taxes and taxes upon property. These were increased, and,
in some cases, doubled by Vespasian. (Soet, Vcsp, 16.) Murrus
is the portion which each had to contribute.-—Gircumeisis qaoe in
