with whom in conjunctiora with the Lygii, whose possessions were
situated in the western part of the Carpathiae dicuntsine, they
waged war. Accordingly, the Hermunduri would live about the
sources of the Elbc, in the north of Bolentia. Their name is not
mentioned by Ptolemy; and as we have not the least hint iu his·
tory that they vvere annihilated in war, it is probable that the Tea·
riochoema, whom he places in their country, were the same people
under another name. In the nnn century they appear in the mma
district, under the name of Thuringi. ln the name Hermunduri,
Hennae is probably not an essential part, but merely marks that
they belong to the Herminones. Duri seems to be their real name,
and this root appears, with a German ending, in Thur-iugi. A di-
vision of the Hermunduri dwclt on the banks of the Danube. in the
eastern part of Franconin. From a fragment of Dio Cassius, we
learn that Domitius Ahenobarbus (Α.Ι). 2) assigned them this abode

when wandering in search of new settlements. The Turoni, on
the northern side of the Mein, mentioned by Ptolemy, are probably

a branchos the same people. The towns mentioned by Ptolemy
ue belonging to them are, Δοκόριτον (Loltr), Σεγόδουνον (Wram-
burg), Δηούονα (Schweinsand, or Deliam), Bepyron (Bamberg, or
Bercht'ng), Μενόσγαὸα (namra), Καντὶοιύις (medanae), Bidoaov

tlements. nt frrst they dwelt in the neighborhood of the Lower
Elbe‚ in the tract called Bardengon, between Magdcbarg, Ldneburg,
and Hamdurg, where the town of Bardaici stands, and in which
they were subdued by Tiberius (Ptol, ii, 113 Veli, ii, 10o), who
moved them beyond the Elbe. They then advanoed more iuto the

· interior of the country, to the neighborhood of the Semnones; and,

together with these, revolted from Maroboduus, under whose domin·

But in the Marcomannis war, having crossed the Danube, they
were defeated by Vindex and Candidus. Allerward, on the decline
of the power of the Cherusci, they extended themselves to the
Rhine; aud here they are placed by Ptolemy, between the Bructeri
