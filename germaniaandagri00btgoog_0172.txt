Squalor. ‘⁴‘ Their squalid disguise.‘’-Fortissimue quisqueferrcum,

under a now os penauce to wear an iron rlng till they had sulfilled
it.-Ignominiosum id genti. ‘¹ It is amarlr os ignominy with that na-
tion.” Literally, ‘⁶ unto the nation.’' The iron ring seems to have

dic. “Until exhausted old age rendere them unequal to so rigorous ι
