deserted its native soil 10 ‹lwell in the forests of Germany, where
severe cold prevailed for the greater part-of the year, and where,
even in summer, impenetrable woods prevented the genial rays of
the sun from reaching the ground. They thought that the Germane
must have lived there from tbe beginning, and therefore called them
indigena, or natives of the soil. (Garama) Modern inquiries, how-
ever, have traced the descent of the Germanic rece from tbe inbab·
itants of Asia ; since it is now indisputably established that 111οΤ011-
tunic dialecto belong 10 0110 great family with the Latin, the Greek,
tho Sanscrit, and the other languages of the Indo-European chain.
Vun Hammer calls the Germane a Bnctriano-Median nation. lle

makes tbe name Germani, or Sermoni, in its primitive import, to have
meant those who followed the worship uf Buddba; aod hence the
Germane, according to him, are that ancient and primitive race who
came down from the mountains of Upper Asia, the cradle of the hu·
man species, and spreading themselves orer the low country more
to the south, gave origin to the Persian and other early nations.

Hence the name Drcbormooio applied in early times to all that tract
of country which lay to the north of the Oxus. The land of Ermum,
therefore, which was situate beyond this river, and which corre-
sponds to the modern Chororin, is made by Von Hammer the native
home of the Germanic rece, and the Germana themselves are, as
he informs us, called Drobermoni, their primitive name, by the Ori·
ental writers down to the fourteenth century. (Wien. Jahrb, vol.
ii.‚ p. 319. Compare vol. ix, p. ³9.) Another remarkable circum·
stance is, that, besides the name referred to, that of the modern
Prnssiom may be found under its primitive form in the Persian
tongue. We have there the term Proscbon, or Pcromlmn, in tbe
sense of ί13000010)ἲ In Meninski (1., p. 533), we bave Beroseon
and Boroscbon, in the sense os “communitae ejusdem religionis ,·”
while in Ferghengi Schuuri, Perosclmn, or Pororcban, more tban once
occurs (vol, i., B.,182, dic). Even the name Scodram, or Sciron
(Saxons), is to be found in the Persian tongue under the form Servon,
as indicating not only the last dynasty of the Persian Empire (the
Sassanides), but also those acquainted with the doctrines of the Des·
satin, the old Persian dialect of which is far more nearly related to
the Gothic than the modern Persian to the German. ln the Orient-
al historice, moreover, mention is made of the dynasty of the sons
of Boia, in whom we may easily recognize the progenitore of the
Boii; while traces of the narne of the Catti may he found in that of
Kal, in tthorasin. (Ferg. Schuuri, B, 231.) Even as early as the
time of Herodotus, the name of the Γερμάνιοι appears among the an-
