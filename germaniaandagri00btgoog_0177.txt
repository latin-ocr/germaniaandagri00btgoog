Boni equique Cherusci. Some derive the name from an old word
chami, meaning “just”. (Ruperti, ad loc.)-Nunc inertes oc stubs
vocamur. The name here referred to rs Thuringi (Thuringer),
from thuring, “ stupid.”- Cattis chronius. Compare Aac, xii, 28,
Dio Caes, lxvii, 5.-Fortuno iat sapientium cassu. “Their good
fortune has passed for wisdom.” The meaning of the whole passage
is this: The success of the catti, which was due to their good for-
tune, has, since they gained the mastery, been placed to the account

quarter here assigned them by Tacitus, namely‚ on the Cimbrie
Chersoneso, or modern Jutiand. Their real country lay, probably,
on the northeast side of Germany. (Consult Geographical ludex.)
-Parcc ncnc civitas. No state of the Cimbri existed here, as we
have just remarked. Tacitus was misled hy some vague report-
Utraque ripa castra cr spatia. “ Encampments, namely‚ and lines on
either bank.’' Another vague statement, and which has given rise,
of course, to a great diversity of opinions. Brotier and others re·
feretroque ripato both shores of the Gimhric Chersonese. Cluver
and Dithmar, on the other haud, suppose that these encampments
are to he sought for either in Italy, upon the River Athesis (Adigo),
or in Gallia Narbonensis, near Aquae Sextio (iiix), where Florus
