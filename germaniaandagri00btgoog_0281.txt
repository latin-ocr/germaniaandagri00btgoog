Batavorum, now laeydes. The chief towns of the Batavi were Ba·

tavodurum, afterward called Noviomagus, now Nymegm or mmm.
pen,- Arenacum, now dreheim, and Trejectum, now Uirrobt. The

name Batavi is preserved in that of Betowe, the name of the district
included between the Rhine of Leyden, the Waal, and ille Lei.
After the death of Galba, when the army on the Rhine followed Vi·
tellius to Rome, Claudius Civilis roused the Batavi to a revolt, which
was shortly asterward suppressed. They were employed by Agric-
ola in his wars in Britain (Agris, 36). The changes which have
talen place in the land in this quarter render the geography some·

what difficult. In the tim'e of Tacitus, most of the Zayder Zee was l

dry land. The rivers, especially the libiae, have very much altered
their courses .......... c. 29

Bon. The settlements of the once powerful Boii are found in
Gaul, and along both sides of the Danube from its source eastward,
probably as far as the mouth of the Eum toward the south, stretch·
ing to the mountains which separate Tyrol from Bovario. The east»
ern part of Swabia, with the whole of Bovario and Bobenia, which
took their names from them (Bavaria havingheen originally Boioria),
belonged to them. They also occupied part of Maronia, and had
settlements on the banks uf the Po. Whether Gaul or Germany
was their original country is uncertain: if the former, it would seem
that they accompanied the first Gallio migratiun mentioned hy Livy
and others, and followed Segovesus into Germany‚ settling in Bo
hemia, but the facts that, for the most part, the tide of migration
set in westward, and that Bohemia has retained its name to this
day, seem to point to Germany as their original horne. From Bc
hemia they were expelled hy tlre Marcomanni, and settled in Nori·
cum and Bavarla, where Boiodurum (Innstodt) took its name from
them. At some period or other, hut when is uncertain, they orossed
the Alps, and established themselves in ltaly, between the Tarus,
the Silarus, and the Apennines. They were subdued by the lto
mans under Scipio Nasica, and afterward removed to the hanks ol
the Druse Alter this they were almost subducd in ware with the
Getae, and an extensive tract in this part was called Deserto Boio
rum (Plio, iii, 24). Some uf the Boii accompanied Brennus in his
invasion of Greece, and joined that part of his army which passed
into Asia Minor, and settled in the country called from them Gala·
tia, where ons of the three divisions of the people hore the name
Tolistoboii. Some of the Boii also joined the Helvetii when they
migrated into Gaul, and were allowed by Cesar to settle among
