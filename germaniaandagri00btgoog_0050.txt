the proposition in, joined with an accusative, includeret the seme time
the ablativo or some other sense; Germ, 46, irs medium relinquam,
i. c, in dubium vocatum relinquam in medio; Arnai, iv, 25, weram
semisomnos irs barbaros, i. a, aderant et irruebant (see below, ΟΝ rus
Posmcer. Couruuuov, dec„ 111, c., y.)= and, moreorer, those in
which the same word refers to different things, eil of which might be
joined with it according to the usage oi the languege; as, Hire, iii,

pacis artibus (expertus), bellis inexpertus. But ‘the zeugma is not al·
ways in the verb, but sometimes, also, in a word joined to it; as, Aa·
