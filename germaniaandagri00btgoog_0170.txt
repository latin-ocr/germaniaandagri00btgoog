this was prosequi. So, in the present case, the settlements 01 the
Catti lie alonge continuone range 01 hills, until the ridge sinks down
and the chain is broken. It then bends 10 the east and leaves the
Catti. ln the bold and vigorous language oi Tacitus, the hille ars
said to escort the catti, and to set them down at length in the lower
grounds, when the ridge sinks and the hilis turn away. Observe,
moreover, the peculiar and striking beauty 01 the possessive suos,
as denoting intimate companionship.

Duriorn empore, duc. 11 Hardier frames (than ordinary), compact
limbs.”—Ut inter Germanos. “As iar as (we may expect this) ’
among Germans.” More sreely, “ considering they are Germans.”
The Germane were regarded⁴ by the Romans as generally deficient
in the qualities to which Tacitus· here alludes. The Romans, how-
ever, mistook mere wantos culture for inferiorityof intellect. Com·
pare the remarks 01 Laden, Greci. der Deutachen, i., p. 117.

Praepoaere eleetos. 11Το place over themselves chosen leaders.''
The catti ohoose able leaders to command their armies when going
forth to war ; whereas, among the other Germane, that one becomes
aleader who is conspicuous sor valor among the soremost cumbat-

that follow is very abrupt, but at the same time very characteristic
01 Tacitus. It is not, 01 course, the historica] infinitive, since the
present would be required here, not the imperfect. Neither is there
an ellipsis 01 solent, as Jacobs supposes. The infinitires in question

(Compare Agris, 14, 18, 27.)-Differrc impetus. 11Το restrain im-
petuous morements.”· The other Germane were wont to rush
rashly on the i0e; the Catii, on the contrary, acted with circum·
spection and judgmeut, and delayed an attack wherevsr such delay
seemed to promise good results—Dispoaere diem, vallare noctem.
11Το assign to each part oi the day its proper duty, 10 sortify them-

under the Prosopopoeia oi Time. ocompare the remarks 01 Bb'tti-

Nec arsi Romane disciplina concessum. In the age 01 Tacitus, the
wars carried on by the Romans were only against undisciplined
barbarians; so that order and discipline might, with some reason,
be claimed as peculiar to the Romans. (Diltlrep, od loc.) We hare
