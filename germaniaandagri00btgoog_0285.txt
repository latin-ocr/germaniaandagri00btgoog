cosnosci. Tbe German tribe of the Cherusci must be carefully
distinguished from the league of the Cherusci. As a tribe, their
possessione lay in the Harz Mountas'm, and on both sides of them,
but chiefly on the south, where the northwest part of the Thdringer
Wntd separated them from the Oatti. The Sala (Scala) probably
formed their eastern boundary; sothai their territory comprehend-
ed the Ducbies os Brunrwick and Magdehurg, with the Principalitirs
os Holbcrstadt, Schwarzburg, Grubmhagen, and Calenbcrg. The
name Hnrz is derived by some from that of Cherusci: in the Peu-
tingerian Table they are called Crherstini. (See Ptol, il.. ll ; Cen,
B. G, vi., 1⁰3 Strabo, vii, 1,a, 4.) Ptolemy places them only on
the south side of the Hara Mountains; but the expeditione of Ger·
monicus show that they dwelt on the north side also. A wall built
between the Steinhudcr Second the Weser separated them from the
Angrivarii (Ann, ii, 19). The Alter probably formed their bound·
ary cn the north and cast, up to the point where it meets the Leiria.
They were at first in alliance with Rome; and Arminius commanded
asquadron of German cavalry in the Roman army, and so far dis·
tinguisbed himself that he was made a Roman knight. Afierward,
roused by this leader, the Cherusci joined the Catti and others in
the attach upon Varus; for a history of which, see Ana, i, 59-6³;
ii, 9-26. They were afterward defeated by Germanicus (Ana, ii,
17). Their strength, however, was not much broken, for the fol·
lowing year they defeated the Marcomanni under Maroboduus, and
were noW, through the courage aud conduct of Arminius, the first
people in Germany. The Cheruscan league included the Dulgibini,
Ansibarii, Chasuari, Chamavi, Tubantes, and Marsi. These and
other small tribes are frequently called Cherusci. Thus the land
between the sources of the Lippa and the Weser, in all the accounts
of the transactione before the defeat of Varus, is called the land of
the Cherusci. But the power and induence which Arminius had
aequired roused the jealousy of other princes, and he was murdered
by some of his own family. With him fell the greatness of the Che-
rusci. Internal dissensions ruined the whole family of their ancient
princes. In the reign of Claudius they sent to Rome to asir, as king,

Italicus, a descendant of the family of Arminius who was bornat
Rome. Being, however, looked upon as an alien, he was‘driven
out, but was reinstated by the Langobardi (Ann, xi, ld, 17). Their
ledgue was speedily dissolved; feuda arose between them and the
nelgbboring tribes, and a considerable portion of their territory was
gresten from them by the Langobardi, and they were driven from

ewest of the deringer Wcld by ths Gatti. Ptolemy mentions.
