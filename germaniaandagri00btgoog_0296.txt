rung northward till it crosses the Mein, then eastward, comprising
what are now called the Spessort Wold and Franlen Wold, through

Hobemia and the north os Hungary. (Cos, B. G.,vi., 253 Strabo,
vil, p. 207, 290, 2923 Plio, xvi, 2; Ptol, ii, 11.) These writers,
however, do not all quite agree in their description. Ptolemy as-
signs much narrower limita to the name, and applies it to the ridga
between the Gabretau Forest and the Sarmatian Mountains‚ which
unite the Carpathian and sudeton Mountains‚ Caesar's account oi
it was derived from report. At a later period, the Romans, in their
wara with Maroboduus, whose possessione lay among the Bobmer
Wald Mountains‚ became personally acquainted with it. Different
names were aiterward given to the several subdivisione of this
chain. Silvo Marciano was the Scbworz Wald, or Black Forest:
this name became known to the Romans in their war with tbe Al·
lemanni; it is found in the Peutiugerian Table. The Helvetii bad
inhabited it in former times, but were expelled by the wandering
Suevi3 Ptolemy called it τὴν Ἐλουηττὶων ἔρημον. Tne name Au
noba, which belongs to tbe ridge in which the Danube risco, was =
given by Ptolemy to a chain os mountains which he makes to run
parallel to the Rhine‚ from the Main to the source os the Amisia
(Eme), which, according to him, rises in it. From Fichtclberg east-
ward, through Bohemia to Moravia, where it meets with the Her-
cynian chain, runs aridge called by Ptolemy Mount Sudeta. South
os this, following what is now called the Bobmer wald, but extend·
ing to a greater breadth toward the north, lay tha Gabretau Forest
(ἡ Γάόρητα ὕλη). On each side os the River March lay the Forest
oi Luna. The most eastern range, extending from tbe Danube,
where it turns southward, to the Carpathian Mountains‚ is called by
Ptolemy the Sarmatic Mountains. These are the mountains and
foreste which are frequently, by the Roman writers, comprehendet]
under-*the name of the Hercynian Forest . . . .c.28
