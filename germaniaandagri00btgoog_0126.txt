baren, “to shout,” -itar being a mere Latin ending. (Adelang,
(ἔωσι. Ait. Deetacll„ p. 388.) Another, but erroneous form of the
word, is bundas, retained in the Glossary of Daoanga ed. limata,
p. 607, but very properly condemned by F1eund (worm, r. a.)
This last-mentioned writer, moreover, is of opinion that Tacitus
her'e erroneously gives the name oftbe warery for that of the war·
song. Several MSS. and editions read turditanis, but there ia no au·

‘thority ιο show that barda, as such, existed among the Germana.
They formed rather a Celtic caste or order. (compare Veget, iii..
18; Amm. Marcell, xvi, ³0; xxvi, 7.)

Terreat enim trepidorum, dte. ‘⁴ For they cause terror, or tremble
themselves with alarm, according as the line of battle bas sounded
forth (the stralo).” Passowplaeesacommaattenmhandmakes
aeica the nominative plural, and the subject of terrem and trepidant.
But the construction sonuit ocior is confirmed by Her, iv„ le, “at
virorum contu, seminarum ululato amauit πίεσθ’-Νη tam occia lue,
quom cirratis, dac. “ Nor does that appear so much a chorus of hu·
man voices as the combined cry of valor itself.” The meaning ia,
that a person, on hearing this martial stralo, would think he heard,
not acborus of human voices, but the ralor that animatas the bosom
ofeach,expressiugitaelfiu oueeombinedandprolongedcry. (Wol-

Fructum marmur. “A broken roar.” 'I'he term murmur isnot
unfrequently employed ιο denote slew, sullen roar, like that of the
sea, theoder, an earthquake‚ dte. (Compare Freand, Wdrterb.,a.o.)· ·
-Quo plenior ιι pamm, &a “ In order that the voice may swell
forth fuller and more sonorous, iu consequence of the repercussiou.’¹

Quidam opinantur, dte. Among these, Strabo (iii, p. 149) cou-
tends that Ulysses advaneed beyond Tartessus, and founded Ὀδύσ-
σεια (“ Olisippo‚’' Lisbon), and Solinus (c. 26, 36) makes him touch
at Britain. Still more extravagant are the speculatione of some

modern writers, who find a resemblance between the Ulysseau ap- ·

pellation' Utis and that of Odia! (Compare Dilthey, od loc.)-Longo
illo otfobuloao errore. “During those long and much-fabled wander-
ings of bis.” Obserre that fabuloso ia bere equivalent to ‘⁶ insubuli}
celebrato.” The allusion is to the Homeric and post-Homeric le·
geuds respecting the wanderings of Ulysses on his return from Troy.

Asciburgium. Mannert, following Ptolemy, makes this place to
have been situate on the right bank of the Rhine, where the canai
of Drusus joined the Yssel¹ and where the modern Ddsburg lies. It
seems more correct, however, to make it correspond to Arburg, or
the neighboring bamlet of Erseoberg, on the left bank of the river,
