the studyof wisdom, moderatioc.'’ The ancient philosophers taught
that nothing is good in itself unless under the regulation os φρὸνη

Plato (Gorg, p. 484, ο.) gives the best commentary upon this
passage: Φιλοσοφία γάρτοι ἐστίν, ὦ Σώκρατες, χάριεν, ἄν τις αὐτοῦ
μετρίως ἅψηται ἐν τῇ ἡλικίᾳ · ἐὰν δὲ περαιτέρω τοῦ δέοντος ἑνδιοτρίψῃ,

ἡλικίας φιλοσοφῇ, ἀνάγκη πάντων ἄπειρον γεγονέναι ἐστὶν ὧν χρὴ ἐμ· ’

been choseu by that general a member os his military family, with
the view os forming a more accurate estimate os his abilitics amid
the familiar intercourse to which this relation would give rise. It
was usual sor young men os rank and talents to be admitted to this
familiar intercourse with the general, as a sort of pupilage, or initi-
ation into the duties of a military lise. Contubernicm properly de·

Suetonio Paulino. Suetonius Paulinus was appointed to the com·
mand os Britain in A.D. 59, during the reign of Nero, and Agricola
probably came with him to the island. At all events, he was in
Britain in Ab. 61.-Approbacit. When a person contracted to per·
