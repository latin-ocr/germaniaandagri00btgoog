which, devised 101 private gain, were endured more grievonsly than
the taxes themselves,” i. 1., were more grievous to he endured, dic.
The meaning is, that Agricola put an end 10 111 those devices sor
enriching themselves which had been practiced hythe inferior 01-

taxes themselves.

Namque per ludibrium uendere 0101010 horreis, &e “For they
were compelled, in mockery, 10 sit by the closed granaries, and 10
buy, besides, their own corn, aud to sell it out again at a (small)
fixed.price.” The meaning 011110 passage hasbeen very generally
misunderstood. The explanation which we 1010 give from Walch
will be found, on examinaticn, to he decidedly the true one. From
the provinces, at least during the times 01 110 republic, and from
Sicily, the Romans procured corn in three different ways 3 namely,
by means 01 110 frenantem decumanum, enitent, and nstiniotum.
(Censuit Cic. in Vera, Aet. 11, lib. 111, 6-98.) The frumentum dr-
cumanum was the tenth part 01 110 produce 01 110 agar publicus or
decumanus. It was exacted irem the cultivators without payment
(Asconius, ad Cic, Vcrr, p. te), and bad to be carried down to the
sea (Cic. in Vrrr, iii, 14), but was generally purchased or con·
tracted 101 by the rencone-lamera, who were thence called 1110-
mani, and who either sent it to Rome 01 sold 11 in the provinces.
The meum frumentum was corn which was sumished in compli-
ance with the orders 01 the proconsul, to supply the wants 01 the
eripies 01 01 110 capital, and 101 which a rixed price was paid, at
11101 from the public treasury‚ and afterward from that 01110 emper·
or. When the governor 01 the province was in league with the
1010010111, 110 111101, by means 01 such edicts as those mentioned by
Cicero (in Vera, 11, 3, 13, 14), get all the com in the country into
their power, as in the case 01 110 Β111010 alluded to in the text,
who were compelled 10 purchase 11 back fromtbe 11011100 11 ahigh
price, bethsur their own consumption, and in order to lumish the
emtum frunwmnm, 101 which they were paid only the small fixed
price. By 11011011,110101010,11 the text, 110 meant the publicet
„Roman granaries, and not, 10 some most erroneuusly think, the
private ones 01 individuale. With regard to ultro, observa that it
