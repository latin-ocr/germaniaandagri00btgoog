Οηιοὲιιοι mem. “The plans and opinions of all.”-Et cclcc atrium
qu emporis ratio αι. “And the account of each time is kept
even.‘' The expression salsa ratio isproperly used when the debtor
aad creditor sides of an account balance one another. So here
Tacitus means ιο say, that by the method they parsued of delibera·

Rhine and Danube, bnt more particularly the former. (compare
