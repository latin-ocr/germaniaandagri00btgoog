tirns emole has remaiued the common reading. But Caligulas
third consulate was in the year 703 ; the consulate of Collega aud
Priscus in sle. According to this, therefore, Agricola would have
died in the fifty-fourth year of his ege, being fifty-three years, two
mouths, and ten days old. To get over this difficulty, some suppose
that Tacitus wrote LIV, and not LVl; others, that he wrote pri·
mam instead of tertiam. The first consulate of Caligula was iu 790,
so that the latter supposition is the more likely of the two, and we
hare accordingly followed it in the text. If, then, we take 700 aethe
year of Agricola's birth, he would be fifty-six years, two mouths, aud
teu days old, aud, accordingly, properly iu his fifty-seveuth year. llut
mlo ιι quinquagesima anno mortam cst may mean that be died either
before or after the completior of his fifty-sixth year. Suetonius
(Aag.,26) says of Augustus : “Gcnmlatam cheriem oetatr’s amic inec
sit.” This was when Augustus wanted thirty-six days of haring
completed his tweutieth year. Livy (Ep, llil), on the contrary, says
“Nonam damam agcm,” of a youth who was above uineteeu years
aud teu months old. Now Agricola was praetor under Nero, aud,
therefore, before June tth, 821. According to Dio cassius (lii,
2⁰), he must have then completed his twenty-uinth year. Taking
the extreme case, if he was pretor aller August aad, 000, he must
have been hcru in 701. But this is impossible, as Caligula was unt
consul in that year; and, accordingly, we can only suppose that he
was born in 700, and thus he would be questor after the completiou
of his twenty-tibh year, tribune after his twenty-seveuth, pretor
after his twenty-ninth, and consul after his thirty-ninth year.
