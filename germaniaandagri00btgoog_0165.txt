CHAPTER XXVIII.

Validiores olim Gallorum, dec. “Tho deified Julius, the highest
of authorities, relatas, that the affairs of the Gauls were formerly iu
amore powerfnl condition than theseos the Germans,” i. e., that
the Gaulo were formerly the more powerful people. The reference
here is to the sixth Book of Oaesar's Gallio Commentaries (cap.
24).-E0qae credibile etl, deo. Compare Cres, B. G, vi, 24.

mantulum enim omnir obstabat. “ For how small an obstacle dir’
a river oppose.” The Rhine, as is well known, has never been a
limit to the moraments of tribes and communitus-Promissam aul
loe, dac. “ As yet lying in common, and divided off by no power
of monarchies,’' i. e, and nnappropriated by any powerful monar-
chias. Some MSS. hare diversae, which forms uo bad reading, di·
verri being used in the sense of separated in Arra, xv, to.

Igitur. For a similar use of mour, at the beginning of a sen·
tence, see Vit. Agr, c. 13.-Hereyniam siloam. Consult Geograph-
ical Index, s. o.-Mooum. The Moenus, otherwise written Manus,
is now tho River Maio. The intermediate forms of the name are
the Mollia aud Moira. (Bisoltoff aad Miller, Wir'rterl. der Geogr, p.
718.)- Ulteriora Boii. For an account of the once powerful tribe of
the Boii, consult Geographioal Index, r. o. Tacitus makes them to
have been of Gallio origin, but they were, more probably, a Ger-
manic racc. Von Hammer, who is an advocate for the Oriental
origin of the name Garatoni (Germanen), traces that of the Boii to
the Persian ¹⁶ Boia.’' (Ferleugi Selouri, B., 221, V.—Kruse, Arellio,
deo, Hesi ii, p. 128.)

Boiemi boumn. “ The name of Boiemum.” Boiemum, or Boibe·
mum, probably means, uthe home of the Boii'’ (heim, hamath).
Some, however, as, for example, Wersebe, think that by Boiemum
is meant what Cesar calls “ oppidum Boioram’' (B. G, vii, 9) iu
Gallia, now Eumelus-Significatum loci oetoem memoriam. “And '

implies a long-standing reminiscente of the original settlement.”-
