cnemis XLIV.

Suionum The Suiones inhabited the south of Swedes, which
was supposed by the ancients to bc an island-Ipso in oceano. ‘⁴ In
the very ocean.” The reference is to their supposed insular situa-
tion. TheoceanmeantistheBalticSea-Eodvffert. “Differsiu
this respect from thet of ours.”-Qood utrimque prora, dec. Rescin-
bliug the canoes still used by the Swedes, aud by our own aborigi-
nes. (Compare Ano, ii, 6.)-Parotam semper amosi, &c “Af-
fords a front always ready for driving up ou the beach.’'—Nec min-
istrantur. “They are neither worked''-In ordinent. ‘⁴ In any
regular order.” Observe the employmeot ofin with the accusative,
on account of the idea of movemeot implied in adjungunt-Solu-
tum, ot in quibusdam fluminum, doc. “Their mode of rowing ia
without any regularity, as (is practiced) in some rivers, and changes,
as occasion requires, on this side or on that.” The movement
herc described is like the paddliug of a conoe-In quibusdomflumi-
num. Proucuns, adJectives, and participles in the plural, joined
with a genitive, are of frequent occurrence in Tacitus.

Est oprld illoc et opibus henou The wealth here referred to was
acquired by traffic. What Tacitus here states relative to their ⁴
honoring wealth is directly the reverse of what was the case with
the other Germana. Of these last our author remarks (chop. v.):
“ Posses-riom et usu houd morde officiuntur,” doc-Nullis jam cz-
ceptiooibor. The particle jam here implies, that as we go further
northward the people degenerata more and more from the spirit of
liberty which characterired the southern tribes, till at last we come
5to a people with an absolute ruien-Non precam jure parendi.
“With no precerious conditione of allegiance.” More freely, “with
an absolute claim upon their obedience.” Precorium jue is arighi
granted to a person’s entreaties. Some editors take parendi in a
passive sense, and adduce, as parallel instances, comoedi coneo (Cic,
Vera, i, 18), echudi (Tiberii, i, 9, 23). But this is unueccssary.

Nec ormo in pembroc. “Nor are arms (allowed to be kept) pro·
miscuously.” Supply concessa aunt-Et quidem servo. ‘⁶ And he,
tco,aslave.’'-Ooecnuo. Their supposed insulan situation-Otiose p
porro amatorum manu, doc. As in the case of the Pretorian sol·
diers and the Janissaries. Some editors give otiooo‚· but the con·
struction cs a singular nonnos multitude with aplural verb is only

ullowable when some clause intervenes aod separatos them. Such.
a phrase as turba ruunt would be inadunatus-Enimvero .....
