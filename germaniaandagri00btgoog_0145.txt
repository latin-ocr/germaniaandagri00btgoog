quien derives from this the origin os amselaga. At first the prinoe
gave to his nobles arms and provisions. As cupidity increased,
money, and then lands, were required, which last, from benefices
(beneficia), became at length hereditavy possessione, and were called
fissa. Hence thoestablishmentot the fendal system. (Espmt dea
Laia, amb.)

Illamballatoramaqaam. “Thatwar-eteed.‘’ Thepronounishere
meant to express gesture, or a pointing at the object sought to be
obtained. So, likewise‚ illam in the suoceeding clause. Observa,
moreover, the expression bellatorem equam and compare Virgil,
Gearg, ii, 145: “Hinc bellator equus eampo seta arduas iasart.'’
Consult, also, Bbttieher’s remarks on the poetioal complexiones the
style os Tacitus-Nam apale et convictae, dac. ‘⁴ For banquets and ’
common tables, although hemely, yet marked by abundant supply,
tale the place ol pay.'' We have followed here the reading of the
earlier editions, 1)] which largi apparatas becomes the genitive of
quality (Zumpt, tlte). This is also given 1)] the Bipont editor,

. and hy PassoW, Hess, Dilthey, and others. The other reading is

as follows: “ Nam apale et, quamquam incomtt' largi tantan appara·
tae,’' dac. “For banquets and entertainments, although hemely,
yet plentiful, take the place ol pay.” In this latter, apparatas be·
comes the nominative plural. The former reading, however, is un·
doubtedly the hue one. The pay ot the companions did not consist
in mero occasioual banquets, hut in their sharing a daily table with
the leader, or, as the term emulatus literally means, “ a living with’'
him. This common table, always plentifully supplied, was occa·
sionally rendered still more so by a banquet on a large scale.

Per balla et raptas. ‘⁶ By means of wars and plundering excur-
sions.'‘ (Compare Caesar, Β. G, vi, 23: ‘⁶ Latrocinia maltam ba·
beat infamiam, qrtoe catrofiaea cujusque timialia ficat.'')-Exspectare
annam. “To aweit the produce ol the year.” Another poetic form

oi expression. Annas is often used hythe poete sor proventae anab
ormassia3 as, t‘or instance, by lateam tituta. (Compare Markland,
ad Stat, Syls, iii, 2, 22.) Agricultura was not entirely neglected
by the Germans; it was only not prosecuted with any great degree

os zeal. (Compare Cels, Β. G, vl, 22 : “ Agricultura nott atcdent.'’)
The cultivation os the delds was lest, as Tacitus himself informs us,
to the women, old men, and wealrest part otthe family. (Via. chap.
xv. Compareohap. xxvi.)

Vocare bootes. “To challenge the foe.” The simple vocare is
here employed lor provocare-Valens merari. ‘⁴ To earn wounds.’'
