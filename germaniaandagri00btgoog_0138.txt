Gauls and Thraciam also honored Mercury above all the other gods.

Gur’ certis dubus, &c “ Whom on certain days they consider it
lawrultopropitiate with human victims alsc.” These victims were
usually prisoners taken 10 war, and the mode in which they were
sacrificed may be learned from Strabo (vii, p. 295). Germanicus
saw in the Saltus Teutobergiensis the altars on which, alter the
overthrow 01 Varus, the tribunes and principal centurione were im-
molated. (Aen, 1., 61.) We find mention 01 human sacrifices
among the Semnones (Gerre, c. 39); the Cimbri (Oros, v. 15); thc
Saxones (Sidonsrlpoll, Ep, viii, 6); the Heruli (Procop, ii, 14);
the Franks (ld, ii, 25), duc. It would be uniust, however, to our
German forefathers to suppose that such horrid rites were confined
to them. They appear to hare prerailed among almost all the aa·
tione 01 antiquity, including even the Greeks and Romam them·
selves. (Plio, H. Ν, ω, 3.)

rag, which it still retains.

Pure Sucronem et Isidi 011011Ἑο01. All kinds of conjectures have
been formed respecting this Isis, and her connection with the Suevi.
The most probable appears 10 be, that by Isis was meant the moon,
which was worshiped hythe Germana (Gce.,B. G, vi.,21.) The
symbol 01 1010 would resemble either a pinnace, or the crescent
moon. (Compare 11111100, od loc.)-Signum iprum. “The symbol
