Taurdwrs, or Tauroin. The name of the Teutones was made
known to the ancients by Pytheas os Massilia (Marcellos), who, in
the age os Alexander the Great, about ³2⁰ B.C., discovered enation
os that name in the Chersonesus Cimbrica, and on the adjacent
islanda, or in the present countries os Holstcia, nclbmig, Μηνὶ,
and perhaps, also, in the southern extremity of Sweden. lt seems
that they had long been settled there, ior they lived in houses, aud
were acquainted with agriculture and commerce. Other traces ol
the name appear later. Among the Celtic tribes which invaded
Greece and besieged Delphi, under the second Brennus (B.C. ete),
there was apeople called Toutobodiaci, who attcrward passed the
Hellespont, and settled with the celte in Galatia, in Asia Minor.
About a hundred and sixty years later, the Romans were attached
by the Cimbri and Teutones, who came from the same country,
where they had been seen hy Pytheas. When the Romans first
heard the name os the Teutones, they thought that they were a single
tribe. They did not know that it was also the general and ethno-
graphic name ot all those nations to which they atierward gave the
designation os Germane.

formed the following words, some ot* which are still used in the
popular dialects: Tetti, “God, creator, ruler, father, nonrisher’
(Tlor, Tuiaco) ; cinciniani, “earth ;'’ tott, dite, dote, ‘⁶ godfather ;”
todo, “nurse ;'’ thiod, “ father os the people,’' “ lord, ruler, king,'’ in
Gothic iliadum, in old Bavarian theodo ,· dict, ‘⁴ people,” in old Swo-
dish thiaot and onya,- tliodinooaus, in Gothic, “kingdom” (Fuldo,
Wnrzei-Wnrterbuci). The names oi king and os people being both
derived from one root, which expresses the notion of ruliug, is a
fact which proves that they belong to the language os a nation in
which thero was neither absolute monarchical, power, nor absolute
submission to their chieis. This corresponds exactly to the politi-
cal state oi the ancient Teutonic nations, among whom the sover-
eignty was in the pcople, and the executive power ot' the chiesa or
nugs, although it was obeyed, was always regarded as derived from

'the people. The idea os roling, expressed by the root Tent, explains
