Muoboduus, who, in his youth, had come ιο Rome aad been edu·
osted at the court of Augustus. He raised his people to a high
pitch of prosperity, and formed a league including a grean number
of the Suevic tribes, of which the Langobardi and Semnones were
the most northerly. His power had become formidable to Rome,
aad Tiberius prepared to invade his dominicos. But a sudden in·
mnection of the Pannonian and Dalmatian tribes compelled Tibe-
rius to conclude a treaty with him (Veli, ii, 108-110 ; Anu, ii, 16).
The Langobardi and Semnones having withdrawn from Marobo
duos, and attached themselves to Arminius, the chief of the Che-
rusci, a war ensued between them. Inguiomerus, the uncle of Ar·

minius, came over to Maroboduus, who was defeated, and compell- ·

ed to retire among the Marcomanni, and apply ιο Rome for assist
ance (Ano, ii, 44-46). It appears thata peace was then concluded
between them. Maroboduus was soon after expelled by Catualda,
and forced totale refuge in ltaly: he lived there, at Ravenna, for
eigbteen years. Catualda was driven out by the Hermunduri, and
also fied ιο Tiberius for protection. The followers of these two
princes were settled beyond the Danube, between the Murano and
Gran, and Vannius, from the tribe of the Quadi, was appointed as
their king (Ana, ii.. 62, oa; xii, 29, ao, Hirt, iii, a). Peace was
maintained between the Romans and the tribes along the Danube
till the reign of Domitian, when hostilities broke out, aud continued
almost nointerruptedly till the destruction of the Roman Empire
(Dio, lxvii, 7; Plan, Pan, viii, 12). For an account of the great
Marcpmannic war, in the reign of M. Aurelius, see Dio, lxviii, 93
lxxi, 3, 8-lb‚ ao-aa; lxxii, 2. After the death of Attila in whose
army they served, they are not any more heard of. Ptolemy men-

Minor. Α German tribe, supposed to have lived at first in the
neighborhood of the Albis (Elia) and Visurgis (Weaer); then be-
tween the Rhine and the Chisala (Yssel), from Padarborn ιο the
Visurgis; and at length, when driven out by Drusus, to have set·
tled in the landa of the Bructeri and Sigambri, between the Amisia
(Eme) and Luppia (Lippe): but from Ano, i.. 45-60, 66, ii.,·o‚ 7,
25, 26, it has been conjectured that their settlements are to be
loched for in the neighborhood of the River Logana (aba). The

Mggsigni (c. 43) are, perhaps, the same race, or their dsscend-
