sectly at liberty to express his opinion oi the velue

os those materials. The notes os walch, in particu- ·
lar, on the Agricola, which sensistin the original·
os more than three hundred closely printed octavo
pagos, form undoubtedly, as has been ramarked by
the English editor, “one oi the most valuable corn·
mentaries ever published upon any classical author.”

The ‘⁶ Remarlss on the Style os Tacitus,” appended
to the English edition, and reprinted in this, are trans·
lated from a worlx ol Biitticher, ‘⁸ De vita, scriptis, oc
stilo Taciti,” Berlin, 1834, and which, to borrow again
the language ol Dr. Smith, “is well known to be a
very excellent introduction to the study of the style
and writings of Tacitus.” The Geographical Index
is confined, as will be perceived, to the Germania, and
enters somewhat fully into the subsequent movements
oi the German tribes. The Geography of Britain
being of minor importasse, has been explained at
once in the notes to the Agricola. The materiale for
the Index have been obtained in a great measure from
the commentary in the English edition, and the pres·
ent work will be found to have gained in this way a
decided advantage hythe separation ofthe geograph·
ical from the explanatory matter. It is a great, but
very common minutato suppose that the ancient
Geography os Germany and Britain, especially tha
former, requires at the present day but little elucida-
tion. The student needs only to turn over a few
pages os Mannert to perceive how utterly erronaous
is such an opinion.

It remaim but to give a list oi the different editions
oi Tacitus, as well as of the other workslrom which
aid has been obtained tor the present volume. ⁵
