of Gemmeus, and granddaugbter of Agrippa, was born in this
place. Itis probable, therefore, that the colony was originally
founded by Agrippa, and was called Colonia Agrippino merely, until
Agrippina, after ber union with Claudius, sent out her own colony,
of which Tacitus elsewhere makes mention (Ann, xii, 27), and the
object of which, in all likelihood, was to strengthen the first. The
name Colonia Agrippinensis began atter this, it would seem, to be
employedincommon with the other. (Compare Ptin, H. N.,iv.,17.)

Experimento fidei. “From trial (having been made) of their fidel·
ity,’' ι’. e., in consequence of their tried fidelity. Observe that en-
perimente is here the ablativeZ-Ut arcerent, non nt custodirentur.
“ To restrain (others), not to be guarded (themselves),” ι’. e., to keep
their own countrymen in cbeck, and prevent tbem from crossing
over into the Roman territories; not placed there themselves to
be watched by the Romans.

CHAPTER XXIX.

Batavi. The Batavi were the inhabitants of South Holland and
some adjacent parts. They occupied the district between the Va·
halis (Woat) and Mosa (Mense), above their junction, and also tbe
island formed by the northern arm ofthe Rhine (or Rhine of Leyden),
the Vahalis and Mosa aster their junction, and the ocean, which
island now constitutes part of Soutb Holland. They seem, also,
from the language of the text, to have occupied a small tract on the
banks of the Rhine, not included iu the insula Batavorum, as it is
called hy Cesar (Β. G, iv, 10). Compare, on this whole subject,
the account given by Tacitus (Hist, iv., 12), and also Geographical
Index.

Ripa. When ripa is used alum, in speaking of the libide, it
generally means, as in the present instance, the left hank of the
stream—seditione dorneste‘ea. Compare Hist, iv, 12. The time

· when this happened is not given. Caesar found thern already es-
tablished in their new seats.·2-In quibus pars Ronmni imperii fierent.
This marks, of course, the consequence, not the intent.

Contemnamus. As referring to the degradation connected with
the payment of tribute—Nec publicanus adterit. “Nor does any
farmer of the ravenue oppress them.’¹ The publicani, or farmers of
the revenue, were principally members of the equestrian order.
They did not themselves, however, take any part in the actual levy-
