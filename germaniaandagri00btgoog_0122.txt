summit of Mount Annonar’ The MSS. have Amabo, Ardone, dcc
The truc reading is Abunde, which was first given as a conjecture
hy Hermolaus Barbarus, and subsequently confirmed 1)] two inscrip
ticos found in thia quartat. Mount Abnoba answers to the northern
part tf the Black Forest, opposite the town of Augusta Rauracorum,
now Auget. (Compare celere, Hiat- S. N. T, iii, 1, 'lr ii, 243]
aud Saoce, N. Arci, 1826, vol. i, p. 153.)

Plures popclm odit. On the right hank, the Vindelici, Norici, Pan·
nonii, Illyrii, Moesi3 on the leil bank, tho Hermunduri, Narisci, Mar·
comanni, Quadi, Daci, Geta, and Bastarnae. (Dihhsy, ad loc.)

See malus. ‘⁴ By six chaunels.” The number of mouths ap-
pertaining to this stream is differently given 1)] the ancient writers.
Herodotus (iv, 7), Dionysius Periogetes, Arrian, claudian, Eusta-
thius, aud others nome five. Pliny (Η. N, iv, 24) and sume other
authorities give six. Strabo, Ovid, Mein, Solinus, and Ammianus
Marcellinus make seven. Tacitus appears to unite the two latter
accounts. At the present day the Danube enters the bea 1)] seren
months.

Erampat. A better reading than mmpit, and sanctioned 1)] the
best MSS. Paasow makesa singular error, when he asserta, in his
commenta on the present passage, and in delence ol erumpit, that
mm with the subjunctive is contrary to the practice ol Tacitus.
The true distinction appears to he this: donec with the indicative
refers to an actual tect, or a thing that is now actually taking place;
but donec with the subjunctive indicates something that ia to be rs-
aliaed, hut has not yet actually occurred. (Compare Waltlur, od
Aac, ii, h.)

CHAPTER 11..

ipsos Germanos, dno. ‘⁴ The Germana themselves 1, sor my part,
helieve to bo au indigenous raca.” The prononn ipsos hero marks
the transition from tho subject os the country to that oi the people
dwelling therein. Obscrve, ruoreorer, that the perfect subjunctive
is here employed to sottcn an assertion, investing it withan air os
modest reserve. (Zumpt, d 527.)—Iodigcnos. Equivalent to the
Greek αὐτόχθονος. This belief in the indigenous origin os different
races was very common among the Greeks aud Romans, though
now deservedly rejected. The ancestors ol the German race mi·
vgrated hy land from Asia, and form one ol the linlrs in the Indo·
European chain of actions. (Compare Gcograph. Index, r. o. Ger· Ι
nanu.)
