had removed eastward, but returned atter the defeat os Varus:
and in the age uf Tacitus, their possessions extended northward to
· the Lippe, where they bordered on the Bructeri, and southward to
the Sieg. Their eastern boundary, according to Ptolemy,·was
Mount Abnoba, or the ridge which runs northward between the

ernrnlr. AGerman tribe, who lived at first on the shores ol '
the Baltic, between the Albis and Vistula, iu Pomerania, and the
west oi Poland; but being forced to evacuate their possessione in
their wars with Aurelian and Probus, they first settled in Dacia and
Sarmatia, then in Pannonia and Gallia, and in the year 406, together
with the Alani, they migrated to Spain. Being atterward overpow·
ered by the Gotbs, they toolr refuge in Africa, and were there sub·

Vsuarbuss. A German tribe, dwelling on the Rhine, to the
east oi the Treviri, and north ot* the Nemetes. Their capital was
Borbetomagus, called asterward Augusta vangionum, and now
Worms ........... c. 28

Vasinr. A German tribe, placed by Ptolemy along the sea, from
the mouth oi the Trave to the Warnc, which last doubtless toolr its
name from them. They were alberward driversinlapd by Slavoriiars
tribes, and united themselves with the Saxone. We lind some
tribes ot' the Varini in Thuringia, others on the banlrs ol the Elbe,
and others in the neighborhood os the Rhine, where they were sub·
dued by the Franks. They also appear on the south os the Danube,
sor they served as auxiliaries under Narses in Italy. Ptolemy calls

Verior. A tribe who lived on the eastern bank of the Vistula,
round what is now the Gnlf of Danrzic, and on the mountains called
from them τὰ Οὐενεδικὰ ὄρη, which separated them from the Got-
ones, in Poicnd, Lithnania, and the eastern part os Procrin. They
were alterward called Winidi, or Wendi. They belonged to the
Slavonians, who, aster the finh century, spread orer the east of
Germany up to and beyond the Elbe, and whose posterity are still
found in Livcnio, Bohemio, Silcric, Moraoic, Lusatia, Pomeram'o,
Stiria, dcc. A dialect oi the Slavonic is still called the Wend lan·
guage. Many suppose that tho Veneti in Italy are a branch ol the
same people, who migrated southward, and that Vindelicis also
took its name irem them.
