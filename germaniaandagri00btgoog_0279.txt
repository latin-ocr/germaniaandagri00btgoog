Arroni. Α German tribe, the earliest record of whom we find in
Tacitus (Germ, c. 40). But this author only mentions their name,
states a few particulare relative to their religion, and intimates that
they were a branch of the Suevi. He appears to have known very
little about them. They are not mentioned in the expeditioris of
Drusus and Tiberius, and, therefore, probably, were at that timeon

· the east of the Elbe. Ptolemy places thern on the west, in what is

now Magdeburg. D’Anville has in his map assigned to them the
earne district which they occupied in the htth century, before their
emigration to England, and parts of which the modern Angles still
occupy. He allots to them the greatest portion ofmodern Schleswig,
and some part of Holstein, making the German Ocean their western
boundary, the Saxona their nearest neighbors on the south, the Va-
rini on the southeast, and the Jutes on the north. lt is impossible
to fix with accuracy any boundaries for the Angli from the account
given by Tacitus; but his statement appears perfectly reconcilahle
with D'Anvillc's map and the Saxon Chronicle. About the middle
cf the fifth century (449) a large body of Saxons and Angles‚ led hy
Hengist and Horsa, sailed over tc England, and established perma-
nent settlements in the island. The Angles‚ however, seem to have
prevailed in numbers or induence, for it was they that gave the
name to their new country, Augei-lond, Anglio (Englond), though it
was sometimes called Saxonis Transmarino. The name Anglo
Saxone, which comprises both Angles and Saxone, was invented by
later historiens for the sake of convenience. (Penny Cyclop, vol.
il, p. 24; xx, p. 492.-Mcrtnert, vol. iii, p. 294) . . .c..40

Ancnrvnnlr. A German tribe dwelling on the east of the Visur-
gis, or Weser, between the Oauci and Cherusci, and extending over
apart of Lr'irreberg and Calcnberg to the Steinituder Sec, which formed
the boundary between them and the Cherusci, and on both sides of
the River Alter. The Lerne seems to have formed their southeastern
boundary. On the northeast they reached to the neighborhood of
the Elbo. lt appears that they dwelt, also, on the west of the Vi·
surgis (Arm, ii., 8). Traces of their name are still found near the
Elbe, in Angcrn, Engern, Engersitousen, Angerrnr‘mde, dre. (Com-
