Some ol the Boii appear to have accompauied thern iu their iuva
sion os Italy. Their name is still preserved in the, national appel-
laticn os the ll'elsh, Cymry. lt is very difficult to decide whether
the Cimbri were a Germanic nr a Celtic tribe. The two races were
not carelully distinguished by the Romarm: Tacitus called them
Germans; but the Cymry certainly are not descendants of the Ger·
mans: their language is a Celtic dialect. In the war with Marius
they were led hy a Celtic commander, and the description of their
arins points to the same origin. Yet we lind them united with the
Teutones. There is a similar difficulty iu the case os the Belge.

Dior. Α triba living between the Danube and the Carpathiae
Mountains, about the Rivers Tibiscus and Marisus (Teis and Ma·
rosch), in the upper partos Hangary, Tranrylaania, Moldaoia, Wal-
laahr'a, and Bessarabia. The first expedition os the Emperor Trajan
was against the Daci, headed by their king, Decebalus ; and the war,
which lasted nearly live years, ended in their submission, AD. 105
(Dio Cara, lxviii, 6, app), to the Roman power. One of their chief
towns, Sarmizegethusa, was aiterward called Ulpia Trajani‚ in
mernory os the victory which was gained. In AD. 250, Dacia was
overrun and conquered by the Goths, to whom it was afterward re·
siguedbytheEmperorAurelian. Domitian celebrated his pretended
exploits against the Dacians by assuming the title Dacicus (Jaa.‚
Sat, vi, 204) ......... c. l

Danuuius. The largest river iu Europe except the Rha, or Volgo,
called by the Germans Dorica, by the Hungariaus Dana, aud hy the
English Danube. Strabo and Pliny make itrise in the chain os
Mons Abnoba, apert oi the Black Forat. According to modern ac-
counts, it originates ou the eastern declivity ol the Black Forest,
about twenty-four miles from the banks ot the Rhine. Its course
is calculated to be about nne thousand seven hundred aud seventy
miles before it enters the Black Sea, and it receives sixty navi-
gable rivers, the largest os which is the OEnus, or Ina, aud one
hundred and twenty smaller streame. As regards the etymology
nithe name, it may be remarked, that Bayer (Commt. Acad. Petrap,
vol. ix.. p. ³75) supposes an early people to have existed, iu whose
language a word like Tan, Tou, Dor, cr Danai may have signified
‘⁸ water,'' from which were gradually derived such names os rivers
as Tanais, Danaperis, Danaster, Danubius, Don, Eridanus, Rhodam
