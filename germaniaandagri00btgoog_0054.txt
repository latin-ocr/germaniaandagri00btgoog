ΟΝ Tllll l’OllTlOAL coMrLame OF THE STYLE OF
mortus.

That there was among the Greeks in tha most ancient times a
great resemblance between the poeta and the historical writers, is
sufficiently proved by that well-known compariscn in which we ara
went to spealr ol Homer, the father osopio poetry, aa an author re·
sembling Herodotus, while we call the latter the Homer of history.
Among the Romans the plau of composing history was differant; lor,

’ having at first attended only to the segistering of annals, and having
thus been accustomsd to set more vulne on the facts themselves, than
on the expression ol the fealings which move the ¹mind in narrating
and judging of the several events, when allerward they were led on,
chiefly by the example of the Graelrs, to aspira to more perfect skill
iu the art os wn'ting history also, they then sought more aster the
ornaments of rhetoric than os poetry. And thus, indeed, you would
justly mention Titus Livius as the most perfect model among all the
Roman historiens, aud as the author who chiefly establishcs the
ability of the Romans for that species of composition, and, above all,
as lar excelling those writers who, like Lucan, Silius, and others,
by doing little more than narrating events iu stiff language, leasened
the gravity ol epic verse and hurt the dignity os history, while they
in vain affected poetical language in order to ornament their recorda
of bare facta Tacitus alone, among all these writers, is worthy to be
compared with those Greeksr because he sought not poetical orna·
ments from without, but was strong in the power ol his own genius,
aud in the innato poetical sublimity of his mind. And as Herodotus
presents to us the likeness of the apic, so does our author chiefly that
of the lyric and &amado muse, by arranging every event be recorda
aster the manner ol a traglc poet, aud in all things exprcsaing the im·
pulser ot' his own mind, nay, even the iumost seelings os his soul.
When, as we read his anuals and historias, we see the efforts mode
by men worthy of a better age against the cruelty os princes and tho
common corruption of manners falling fruitless to the ground, but yet
perceive, at the same time, that there can be good and brave meu even
under evil rutam when we behold fortune, iate, nay, the gods them·
salves, ruling in a wonderlirl and ever inscrutable manner the divers
chauces ol human events3 as we contemplate in his boolrs os annuls
the fatal extinction ol the Julian racc, and in his historica the mighty
efforts to establish anew an empire already desolate and falling; do
we not seem to oumelves to he reading some tragic composition, such
as those os AEschylus, Sophocles, Euripides? is not the maurnful
image of a Niobe presented before our eyesl are not our souls per
