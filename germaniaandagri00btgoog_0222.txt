Agitasse 0. Cesaram de intranda Britannia, &a “That Caius
Cesar had meditated the design os invading Britain is quite certain;
(aad he would have done so) had henot been precipitata in forming
sehemes, fickle ia changing his mind, and had not his mighty at-
tempts against Germauy proved fruitless.‘’ (Consult Saea, Calig,
46; Dio Casa, lix, 25.) This expedition was undertaken not from
Gaul, but from the Batavian shores. The light-house, which Ca·
ligula built, was at the second mouth of the Rhine, now choked
with saud, where the remeius of it still exist, aad are called by

account is imperfect. As only Cynobellinus⁷s sons, Oaractaous aud
Togodumnus, appeared iu the field against Plautius and Vespasian;
and, alter the capture oi Camulodunum, the war was considered as
completed; it appears probable that most of the tribes south os the
Thames and Severn were under the dominion os mactemus.-
Oapti reges. Who these were we do not know. Bede says the
country was divided among twenty-five petty kings.

Momtratas satis. “ Was pointed out by the tates.‘’ As this ex-
pedition laid the foundation os Vespasian’s subsequent elevation to
the throne, by the fame which he thereby acquired of a successful

ablative without a, instances of which construction are not unfre-
