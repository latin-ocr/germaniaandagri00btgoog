Aah. A German tribe, supposed to have lived bytho Sudetan
Manliana, in the neighborhood of Amaras a'nd Arcobarg. Their
name appears to contain the same root which we find in the names
of many natione of the IndoGermanic family; and it is not im-
probable that all the different branchos of the Indo-Germanic racc
may have originally been called by this name. According to He-
mdotus (vii, 61, 62), the Medes were originally called Arii, and the
Persians Artci. These names are identical with the Sanscrit word
Arya (which means “ honorable,” “entitled to respect‘’), by which,
in the ancient writings of the Hindus, the followers of the Brohman-
ical law are designated (see Rosen, iu “ Quarterly Journal os Ed-
ucatioo,'’ vol. ix, p. 336). India Proper is called in the most ancient
Sanscrit works Aryaaarta, (⁴⁴ holy land).’· The same name was re-

Brrrvr. (Quantity of the penult doubtful, but more frequently
long than short.) Α German tribe, who occupied the island formed
by the Vahalis (Waal) and Mosa (Mensa), and also that formed by
the northern armos the Rhine (or Rhine of Leyden)‚ the Vahalis
and Mosa after their confluence, and the ocean They seem, also,
from the language of Tacitus (Germ, c. 29), to have occupied a
small tract on the banks of the Rhine, not included in the insula
Batavorum, as it is called by Gaesar (B. G, iv, 10). The Batavi,
therefore, were the inhabitants of South Holland and some adjacent
parts. They became the allies of the Romans under Augustus.
Drusus, the brother of Tiberius, dug the canal called Fossa Drusiana,
⁸ which jolns the Rhine and Yssel. On the northwestern part of
the island dwelt another people of the same origin as the Batavi,
the Canninefates (Hieta ir.. 15), whose chief town was Lugdunun
