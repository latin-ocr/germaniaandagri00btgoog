wlry this word occurs so frequently in the names os the ancient Teu·
tonic luinge, dukes, or chiese, such as Teutohoch, Theudoria, Diorix,
Theodorix, Theodoric, Theodomir, Theodimir, Teutagon, dcc. It
is likewise contained in the general name of all the Teutonic na·
tione, and in thone ol various tribes, as the Teutones, the Teutono·
arii, Thallali, and the Dithmerses, or Dietmarses. lt is visible in
⁴⁴ Teutoburger wam‘* the name ol that range ol wooded mountain·

which stretches from Daemold westward beyond Ombreck, in which
is situated the Grotenhorg, formerly “Tem'’ or ⁶⁸ Teutoberg,” with
the sarm ol Tantalos, where Vanis was overthrown by Arminium
in “Detmold,” “Decedam’' “Dumium’' “Deua” and in a grem
manyotherlocalitiesinGermany. Teutonisidentieal with Deatocln
or Teutrche (iu low German Ditem, in Dutch Deitach in Danish
Tyri, in English Dretcb), which, from the remotest time, has been
end ia still the general name ol that part oi the Teutonic natione
which we now call Germane, who considered the god or hero Tuisco
aa their common aneestor. There ere no direct prooss σι’ the word
'l'euton having had this extensive meaning in the earliest German
history, bnt this ia, perhaps, the result ol the political etate oi the
Teutonic natione, which were originally divided into numerous
tribes, each ol which became separately known to the Romans. ln
the tweltth, eleventh, and even as early as the tenth century, when
the difference between Franks and Saxons was well marked in the
German empire, these natione, each oi which had its own language
and lawe, never objected to being called hythe general name oi
Deutsche, or Teutones. At present there is no German tribe which
has the particular name ol Teutones, bnt although the Germane are
composed oi two very distinct natione, the High Germana and the
Low Germane, they eall themselves Deutama and their langnage
Deutscb, though they do not understand each other. (Pecoy cyclo-
poedia, vol. xxiv. ,.p 262.)
