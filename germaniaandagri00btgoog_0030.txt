'l'so1nus generally preserved in his laugusge the usage of former
wnitere, snd chiefly of the historiam and only deputed from it in
such e degree as to improve and increase certain peculiaritiea which
the ancient writers sometimes display in single inomao, and in
which they, too, have mosny followed the language of the poeta It
istuue, he adopted the usage of his age, and indulged his own pecul-
icr genius in new constructione, and in the formation of compound
words, bnt he never, in these instances, hansgressed the laws of his
native tongue: like a great legislator, who best provides for the com·
mon welfare by retaining, on the one hand, the customs of antiquity,
while he also employa his own genius in inuentiug lsws which are
better and more suited to the demands of his age.

There are, indeed, many passages in his writings which ere render·
ed obscure by a conciseness almost inhicate and abrupt; many which,
departing from the common mode of speech, cell for much attention ’
ἱιι the render. But just aa the milk like exuberanoe of Livy aad the
wonderful clearness of Cicero delight the mindo of their madero, end
gratify them with a pleasure which is presented, as it were, spon·
taneously, and obtained by no great laben so the brevity of Tacitus,
obscure, indeed, but never unpleasing, never impenetrable to the
edge of genius-while it calls forth all the reader's strength, aad
never suffen his mind to be inactive, but always engages him more
and more in new efforts to imbibe deeply the loftiest and most
heautifin sentimenta-iills aud pervadas with a joy muredly not in·
ferior, nay,impe1ishable, the minda of those who come to the perusa!
of the work» of Tacitus, not as to thicketa bristling with thoms, but
as to a consecrated grove, glimmering with a doubtful but holy light.

Now the lawa which Tacina hus followed in the composition of his
, writings, and the sources from which chiefly all those things prooeed
which constitute the peculial-Ity of his style, may be most convenient·
