“The decision oi which rests with the people.¹¹-Pertructeutur
This is tha reading oi all tha early editions, and oi almost all tha
MSS. Muretus and others, however, 'preferred prauooteutur ,· but,
in the first place, the words eu quoque militate against thia oonjeo-
ture, and, besides, pratroctareis found nowhere else, and is, in fact,

‘¹ On stated myst-eum aut inchoatur luno, dno. The moon was
one ol the prinoipal deities ol the Germane (Cae, B. G„ vi, 21),

reckoning appears in the words se’nuigbt and sortuigbt. compare,
also, the language ol the Saored Writings: “ And the evening und
the morning were the first day’' (θαι, i.. b); and, again, “ln the

the number has appeared sufficient‚’' i. a, lor the transaction oi
