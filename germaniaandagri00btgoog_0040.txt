ΟΝ THE Fortcn AND ssanlTY ΟΡ THE STYLE Ol*
Tacitus.

All agree, without any hesitation, thot the peculiar character oi
’ Tacitrrr'a style ia aean meet in the concise brevity oi hia langnage3
und thone who have looked into it more closely, till they have even
explored all the inmoet reccarea oi hia sometimes ebrupt diction, pre·
ier Tacitus to all other writera ior thie very reaaon, and admira the
divine aspect oi hia geniua, which, the nearer they approach it, and
the more intently they hang upon ita contemplation, ao much the
more deeply penetrales the minda ci' the beholderc. But is you ask

whence proceeds and what meana that taciturn brevity, and where·
iore itin that yon are cometimea moved by it in the inmoat corner oi

your heart, aeek the anrwer tium actrralliie, both that of Tecitm and
your own. Many were then (aa now they are, if we would honest·
ly confeaa it) the inulte, the vicen, the crimea of men, with but rare
enamplca oi mbatantial, well-nied viram great were envy and the
ignorance osright; many were the mockerier that were made os the
affaire of men, and the empty dnaenaiona oi the populace; while bnt

. very few then, aa in our own time even by no meana all, were aeelr·
ing better and higher things. And aa it by no menne becomes ua,
who ara bleaaed with tha hopea and consolatione os the Chriatien
saith, tc mourn orer thore thing· which are faulty in our own age
with the came grief aa that with which wc behold c Roman, who ao·
ccunted nothing to be loftier aad granden thanthe hereditary glory
and majeaty of hia country, mourning over the common corruption oi
all thinga, and orer the republic falling headlong to rnin; ao we aure-
ly can not blame in Tacitur that kind of bitter pleaaure, and that in·
dignent aparing os worda, by which, thet he might not, like Sue·
tonius, impoae too haevy a burden ou hir own and hia readera’ aeneo
of chame by narrating every thing at length with a diagnating loqua-
city, he haa generally conveyed a deeper meaning than hia worda
