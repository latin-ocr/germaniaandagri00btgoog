⁴⁴ The style of Tacitus, especially in his ‘Annala’ is the apt expres·
sion of his thought: concise, vigorous, and dnmatic. lle has, per·
haps, attained as great a degree of condensation aeis compatihle with
perspicuityr sometimes his meaning is ohscnred hy his lahor to be
brief. His historical works are especially works of art, eonstmcted on
alixed principle, and elaborared in ohedience to it. He loves te dis·
play his rhetorical ski11‚bushe suhdues it to hia dramatic purpose.
lt is a fault that his art is too apparent, that hia thoughts are some·
times imperfectly or obscurely expressed, that he affecta an air of
mystery, that his reflectione on events are osten an inseparahle part
of them, aud, consequently, the impressione which itis his object tc
produce can only be rectified by the vigorem scrutiny of e matured

mind. Yet those who have made Tacims a study generally end in ⁰

admiring him, even for some of those qualities which at first repelledr
almost every word has ite place and its meaning, and the contrasr
between the brevity of the expression and the fullness of the thought,
as it marks the highest power of a writer, so it furnishes fst matter
for reflection to those who have attaiued a hhe intellectual manarity.

“Tacitus must have had abundant sources of informationi, though
he indicates them only occarionally. lle mentions sevmal of those
historiam who lived near his own time, as Vipsanius Messala and
Fabius Rusticusr he also speaks of the memoire of Agrippina and oth-
ers. The Orationes Principum, the Fasti, the Acts of the Senate,
and the verinus legislative mensures, were also sources of which he
availed himself. It has been already intimated that the minute de·
tail of events was often foreign to the purpose of Tacitus, and, accord·
ingly, he is sometimes satisfied with giving the general effect or
meaning of a thing, without aiming at perfect accuracy. Thus we
cau not always collect with certainty from Tacitus the provisions of
the Senatus Consulta of which he speaker aud for the purpose of any
historicul investigation of Roman legislation, his statements must
sometimes be enlarged or corrected hy reference to other sources,
aud particularly to the ⁴ Digeet.' ”
