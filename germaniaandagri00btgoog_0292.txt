cient Persian tribes (Herod, i , 125), while the analogies between the ⁴
Persian and German are so striking as to have excited the attention
oi every intelligent scholar. And, besides all this, an ancient Geor-
gian MS. os laws‚ not long since brought to light, proves con·
clusively that the Georgian nation had among thern ordinis precisely
similar to those oi the early Germans, and also the same judicial
forms os proceeding‚ and the same system oi satisfactione to be
paid in cases oi homicide, according to the rank ol the party slain.

the whole subject, Krase's Archia der Germanicclian Viillrerstiimma,

ceived etymology os the name Germani, which makes it equivalent
to ‘¹ war-men,’' or “ warriors,’' falls, oi course, to the ground. (Con-
sult notes on chapter ii.) It may not be amiss, however, alter
having stated what appears to be the most probable view os the
subject, to give a sew other etymologica sor the name Germani, each
ai which has its advocates. Thus, Althamer makes Garnaanas
equivalent to “ lamo prorsus virilis,'' and the same, in fact, as Al ·
man, i. e.‚ Gaea-Manna Wackernagel, anthe other hand, explains

’ Germane by G’armanua, i. e., Valksgcnaaaa. Luden thinks that the
term Germania is nothing more than the German Walirmannai, aud
that there were several such Germanicam ‘⁶ confederacies” (Eiasge-
nossanachasren), such as those os the Cherusci, the Catti, the Cauci,
&e ; and hence the union oi all oi these would form what he terms
·‘Gcrammtgcrmanien.” (Ga-scii. dar Dantrchen, i, p. 163.) And,
nuely, the name Germani is supposed hy some to he derived from
gar, which, according to them, appears in the French guerre, “ war,”
and man. (Compare the etymological remarks under the article
Teutanes.)

Our information concerning the geography os ancient Germany is
very scanty and uncertain. The Greek and Roman writers, from
whom our knowledge oi it is derived, knew very little about it thern·
selves. A knowledge of the German Ocean, and the northern parts
oi Europe, had been acquired, first by the Phoenicians and Cartha·
gimnus, who procured tin irum the Cassiteridas or from Britain, and
amber from the shores oi the Baltic (see e. 45); aud, in the year
Β C. 400, by Himilco the Carthaginien, whose voyage has been de-
scribed by the poet Avienus (Plin, ii, 67); iu BC. 330, by Hecataeus
and Philemon (Plan, iv, 13, or 27); and about the same time, by
Ephorus and Clitarchus (Stral, vii, 2, 1, p. 293) ; by Timaeus, Xen-
