Since. Erroneously rendered by seme “ bays.” This term is
applied to any thing that makes a bend, and is most frequently
used of any thing which is hollow, as avallsy, a gulf; but it also
means a promontory, or a neck of land, where the houndary linc
makes ahend or sweep, and such is its force in the present passage ;
and the allusion appears to he to the bold projections of the German
coast along the Ocean and the Baltie, more particularly to what is
now denominated Jctland, and to the headlands near the mouths
of the Eme, the Weser, and the Elhe. (Compare Porrow, Walther,
and Gerlach, cd loe, and Voss, cd Virga, Georg, ii, 123.

Ques tellum aperuit. “Whom war has diselosed to our view”
By hedam is here meant a series of warlike expeditione. The

meaning to he assigned terrereris, and compare note on nec ohligan-
tur, e. 21. It is better to make ceraue a participle here, than to eou-
sider it, as some do, a preposition used pleonastically. Ernesti and
Brotier, indeed, adopt thislatteropinion, hut without much propriety,
since Tacitus nowhere else employs such apleonasm as in . . ..
verser, cred . . . . resae. The reference in the text is to the heud
of the Rhine near Arenaeum, th'e modern Amheim, in the Grand

Duehy of Baden, not very far from the mouth of the stream. Bel-
ker, Ruperti, and others erroneously suppose another hend of the
Rhine to he meant, near Basilea, the modern Baset, or Βάὶε. (Com-
