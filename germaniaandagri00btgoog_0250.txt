The meaning is as follows: the greater part are either the betrayers
of their country, as the Britanni ; or are fighting in a foreign land,
as the Batavi Tungri, Galli, dre—Peneos numero, circum trepidos
ignorantia. Some editors take circum trepidos to be equivalent to
circum trepidantes, or trepide circum vagantes, while others striks out
orcum. But that would be equivalent to saying, Qui non sulm om·
nino trepidi sunt ignorantia, verumetiam ignorant, qne in coelo, duc,
appareant. Most probably some such word as immansionem, or
regionum has beenlost before circum. Circum must then be taken
as in Ann, xii, bb: “Duri circum loci.” The words may then be
translated, “A few in number, dismayed through their ignorares
of the surroundIng country.”

CHAPTER XXXIII.

Excepere mationem, &a “They received his harengue with ex· .
cited feeliugs, and, atter the barbarian manner, with songs, aud
yells, aud dissonant cries.” The verb excipere is used iu the same
manner by Livy (xxiv, 31), “Exceptus elamor ab eliis? compare
Ann, il.. 38: ‘⁶ Hac plures per nimirem aut ceodrum murmur enee·
pere.”-Jamqne agmina, &c Supply apparent. The ellipsIs of this
verb is common in Tacitus-Aniensem cujusque procursu. ‘⁶ lu
