dition was the same anthat of the vassals, or serfs, who a few cen-
turies ago made up the great body of the people in every country
in Europe. They were attached to the soil, aod went with it like
the Roman ochoi, and hence we see why each had nn ahode (ordeo)
of his own, and regulated his own household affairs (soor penates).
The Germane, at a later period, imitating the Romans, had slaves
of inferior condition, to whom the nameus slave became appropri-
ated; while those in the state of rural vassalage were called Lideo
(Liri or Lilonca). (consult Grimm, Deutsclrc Rechteoltrrtlriimcr, p.
300, seqq.)

Ut colono. “As upon a tenant‚” i. e, as upon one os those whom
we Romans term coloni. Τὴθ term colonos is here employed in the
sense which it had during the later imperial period. The coloni paid
a certain yearly rent sor the land on which they lived, and were at·
tached to the soil (glebo adscripti), from which, us a general rule,
they could nothe separated. (Consult Dict. Ant, s. o. Prndium.)
-Et servos horterum paret. “And the slave thus far obeys,‘' i. c,
the slave is not bound to render any other services.

Cetera mmor officim duc. “The other, (which are) household
duties, his own wife and children discharge.’' Domus here refers
to the house os the master, and not, as Passow erroneously supposes,
to that os the slave. The Gennans did not employ slaves atthis
period in household duties, but used sor this purpose the services οἰ
their own wives and children. (Orelli, adl .) Observe,moreover,
the peculiar employmeot os celcra in the present passage, and com-
pare the explanation oi Walther, “ atrro fficio, scilicet domur οβῐεὶιι.υ

Verberon serenos, dic. Tacitus opposes this to the cruelty of
masters among the Romans. Various laws were enacted by Ser·
vius Tullius, Augustus, Hadrian, aud others, to check the cruelty
oi' the Romans toward their slaves. (Consult Seuero, de Iro, iii..
4⁰3 Id, de com, i., 183 Iu, Epist, 46, 473 Plio, H. N, ix, aar
Juvenal, vi, 219, Hcym, opusc, vol. iii, p. 189.)

Non disciplina et severitate, doc. “Not in the way of chastisc·
ment, and from any severe infliction oi the same, hut from the im·
pulso os the moment, and anger (in particular, as the exciting
cause).” We must he careful not to regard this as a mere hendi-
adys sor discipline remote ond impeto iro⁴ lt is, in reality, a
uruch stronger formos expression. Compare the remarks os Bot-
ticher on the socalled figure ἓν dul δυοῖν in Tacitus, p. xlvi-Nisi
qood impune. “Except that they do it with impunity,'‘ i. a, kill a
slave with impunity. A private enemy could not he elain wrth
impunity, since a fine (Wergeld) was affixed to homicide; hut a
