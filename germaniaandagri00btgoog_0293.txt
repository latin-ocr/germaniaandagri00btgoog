ophon of Lampsacus, Sotacus, Nicias, Xenocrates, Mithradates, and
especially Pytheas of Massilia, who, iu the year DC. 320, sailed to
Thule, aud thence into the Baltic. (Such, i, 4; ii, 3, 4; 111, 2,
11.,4, ὁ. Ptin.. iv., 16, 0127, 30; xxxvii.. 2, or ll.) The knowl-
edge which tho Romans possessed 01 Germany and the western
parts 01 Europe was derived principally from the expeditioris 01
Cesar, Drusus Germanicus, Germanicus, and Ahenobarbus. Dm-

sus Germanicus, the brother of Tiberius, made four expeditioris into ²

Germany, and dng the caual between the Rhine and the Chisala
(Ysrcl). He was the first who navigated the German Ocean, bnt
did not advance further than the mouth 01 the Amisia (Ems), iri the
territory 01 the cauci. Germanicus, the sori 01 Drusus (11.1). 11-
16), made four expeditioris into Germany, and advanced still further,
he was shipwrecked on the territory of thc Frisii (Aac, i., 49-52,
lib-59, 60-71 ; 11, 5-26, 41-16), L. Domitius Ahenobarbus crossed
tha Elbe, and penetrated further into Germany than any 01 his pred·
ecessors. (Anu, i., 63; iv.,44. Suet, Ner, iv.) Tiberius ad·
vauced 10 the hretic Sea (Ana, ii., 26, 47; xii, 39. Dio, lv., 6, 8,
2& lvi, 25. Suet, Tib, 9, 17, 18, 20. Veli, 11, 97, lot-110, 120.)
This expeditiori 01 Tiberius, however, Strabo (vii, 1, 01191) and
Tacitus himself (c. 94) attributa to Drusus Germanicus. On the
south side 01 Germany the Romans made no conquests beyond the
Danube, but they obtained some geographical knowledge through
the journeys 01 the tradere who procured amber from the shores 01
the Baltic, and from their wars with the Daci, Marcomanni, and
other tribes on this frontier. Strabo wrote in the age 01 Tiberius,
when the Romans possessed a more accurate knowledge 01 Germani
than at any other time, through tlie expeditioris 01 which we have
just spoken. After this period the Romans were almost entirelr
shut out 01 Germany. Strabo, however, is exceedingly careless,
He did not read everi Cesar’s Gallio war with sufficient attentionto
understand it, and confuses almost every thing which he extracta
froin the accounts brought horne by Pytheas. Our difficulties are,
morenver, increased hythe inaccuracy 01 the text. Pomponius
Mela is worth nothing. Pliny, likcwise, was very careless, as we
see, everi in what he says 01 Italy, we can not, therefore, look for
much accuracy iu his account 01 Germany. His work is principal-
ly valuable for the proper names. Tho imperfect character 01 tho
geographical knowledge which Tacitus possessed of Germany is
manifest from his work upon the subject. Ptolemy has ventured
to give a map 01 Germany, and 10 lay down the latitudes and longi·
tudes of s number 01 towns and mouths 01 rivers. The greater part
