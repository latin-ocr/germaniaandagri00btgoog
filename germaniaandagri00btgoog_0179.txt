posse.''-Quippe regno Arsacis, dcc. “No doubt because the im-
patience of control which characterizes the Cermans is more vigor-
ous than the despotism of Arsaces‚” i. e.. proves a greater stimulus
to exertion. Observa that regno Arsacis is the same as regno Par·
thiro, the monarchs 01 Parthia being in the time of Tacitus of the
dynasty of the Arsacidae, so called from Arsaces, the founder ofthe
empne.

Quid enim aliod, dcc. “For what else has tha East, humbled
beneath a Ventidius, Pacorus himself also having been lost, to
boast of against us, save the slaughter of Crassus t’t Crassus was
defeated and slain by the Parthians, BC. 53. Alter the defeat 01 P.
Decidius Saxa, lientenant of Syria, by the Parthians, and the seia
ure of Syria by Pacorus, son 01 King Orodes, P. Ventidius Bassus,
having been sent thither by Marc Antony, slew Pacorus, and com-
pletely restored the Roman affairs. Ventidius himself, however,
was a man of very inferior ahiiity, and of very low origin, having
been originally a mule-driver; and he had risen to the command of
the Roman armies in this quarter solely through the favor of An·
tony, whom he joined with three legions after the battle of Mutina.
Hence the peculiar force of dejectae infra, as implying that the once
haughty empire of the Parthians had been brought so low as to he
compelied to yield to the arms of a Ventidius. (111111ιο,αά loc.)

At Germani Carbone, dcc. Cn. Papirius Carbo was defeated by
the Cimbri at Noreia, BC. 113 (Lis, Ep, 63); L. Cassius Longi-
nus (ΒΩ. 107) was sent under the yoke and elain hy the Tigurini.
who had Joined themselves to the Cimbri. (Cea, B. G, i., 7, 12;
Veli. Patere, ii, 12); M. Aurelius Scaurus, the same year, was de·
feated and taken prisoner by the Cimbri, and putto daath by Boi·
orix, a chief, or, as Livy styles him, a furious youth (seror ynas-
me). He had excited the ire of the barbarinos by advising them
not to enter Italy, assuring them that the Romans were invinclhle.
(Lis, Ep, 673 Vett Patere, ii, 12.) Q. Servilius Caepio and Cn.
Manlius (BC. 105), through their rashness and dissensione, suffered
asevere defeat from the Cimbri, near Tolosa. (Lis, Ep, 67 ς Veli.
Patere, ii, 123 Vol. Mam, iv, 73 Plus, Mor, il.)-Cnaeo quoque
Manlio. All the old MSS. and editions have M. qnoque Manlio. Cn.
and M. are frequently confounded in the MSS. In the present in·
stance, however, the true reading is Caco, since it had been decreed
after the death 01 M. Manlius Capitolinus, who was accueed hythe
patrician party of aiming at royal power, that no one of this family
