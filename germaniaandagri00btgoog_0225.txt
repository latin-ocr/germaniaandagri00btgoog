tion; not merely one king, which would be onam regern-Serius.
Observe the employment os the subjunctive, as indicating the sea·
timente os the speaker, not those os the writes-Eque discordans
prepositorum, duc. “That in aa equal degree did the discord os
those placed over them, in an equal degree did their anion prove de-
stmctive to those subjected to their sway.” Observa here the em·
ployment of nque . . . . oque. So we have pariter. . . . pariter ia Orid
(Mea, xii, 36): “ Et pariter Pheias, pariter maris ira recessit.”
The use os atquc in such phrases as aliud atqie arose from the
omission os one aliud, which occurred in the fuller aad original form
os the expression, aliud boc atque aliud illud.

Alterius manus, dac. “ That the officials ot the one, the centuri·
ons os the other, mingled violence and iasults,” i. ι, treated them
with mingled violence and insuit. The first αὶειτίιιε refers to the
procurator, and hy manus are meant his under-officere and attend·
ants; the second altram refers to the legatus. We have given
here the reading suggested by Gronovius (Diatrr'b. ia Stoa, p. 264),
and which appears to great advantage hy the side ol the strange
emendations which different editors have proposed. The whole
question is sully discussed in Walch’s note. ’

In prelio fortiorem csse qui spoliet. “Thac in battle it is the
braver man who despoils.'‘ Observa, again, the employment of the
subjunctive in spoliet, as indicating the sentimenta of the speaker,
not os the writer-Tamquam mori tantum, dac. “Aa if they were
ignorant only how to die sor their native land.” Compare the anal-
ogons Greek constructiones ὡς with the absolute case ot* the par
ticiple. ,
Quantam. “How mereahandful.” One af the MSS. hasqaorr-

tantas, priuatas, and the like, are employed to express diminutiones

usual construction in sentences of this kind; as, “quaatum .....
profici (Hist, iii, 70); “ Quid dicturae’ (Ia, iii, 13). But tha sub·
