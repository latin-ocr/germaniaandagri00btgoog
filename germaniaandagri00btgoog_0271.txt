(Ana, xiv, 9). It appears that Tacitus and his wile, at the time
os Agricola’s death, had been four years absent from Rome, on what
account we are nowhere intormed. Some critias suppose that he
was banished by Domitian, but this seems to be without any loun-
dation. The fact ol his absence may be gethered, also, from Pliny
(Ep, vii, 33); lor the nequest which he makes, that Pliny would
tumlsh him with a detailed account ol Senecio's suit against Bebius,
was occasioned by his being away at the time from the capital. lle
was present, however, at Senecio's death, in the year 846, when

, he returned from the administration of his pretorian province.

Si quir norum monibus locus. ‘⁶ Is there be any abidingplace lor
the shades of the virtuens'’ The religious opinions of Tacitus par·
took ol the character os his age: he had no strong convictione, no
settled heliel ol a moral government os the world, his love of virtue
and his abhorrence ol vice were purely morah they had no reser-
encetoaluture existence. (CompareAnn.,iii.,'18; ri.‚22.) On
the present occasion, in this, one ol his earliest productione, he
hopes, rather than expects, that the souls of the departed may still
live and be conscious oi what is passing on earth; but in his latest
writings there are no traces that his hopes orbis wishes had ever
ripened into a belief.
