os these he never visited himself, and who, in that age, could have
furnished him with the requisite informationi Iudeed, his map
bears but a saint resemblance to tho actual shape and features os
Germany; and, in the majority os instanoes, it cau with difficulty be
. determined whether the towns he mentioned existed at all. There
· is this additional disadvantage iu his book, that he detines positione
by numbers, which, os all things, are the most liable to alteration
through the mistahes os the transcribere. One oi the most valua-
ble geographical monuments oi antiquity‚ Antoninus’s itinerary‚
compiled under the direction os J. Caesar and Antony or Augustus,
is available only sor a few roads on the frontier. The Peutingerian
Table is frequently oi uso in making maps; since, though the
countries are excessively distorted, the distances between the towns
laid down on it are given: but it isos scarcely any service in the
case oi Germany. Inscriptions and coins, again, which afford some
oi the best means oi defining the situations of places, are os rare
occurrence in Germany. But, in addition to all these difficulties and
disadvantages‚ the wandering and unsettled character oi the Ger·
mans themselves renders it totally impossible to lay down a map
which should represent the relative positione oi the tribes at any
one period, or sor any length os time, though we can generally
determine the position which individua] tribes occupied at some
time or other. This is seen from the wide discrepanoies between
Tacitus and his contemporaries, and Ptolemy, and srom such
glimpses as history affords us oi the migratione oi several ol the
tribes. . . . . . .c.2‚ 16, trauehendo.

Gornivr. A German tribe, who are supposed by some to have
lived in Cracow, or on the banks nithe Marus (March), as it is said
that the Quadi imposed a tribute upon them ; and Ptolemy (ii, ll)
mentions towns here having a Celtic name aud origin, adding ὑφ’
οὓς (τοὺς Κουάδους) τὰ σιδηρωρυχεῑα (either where are the modern
Feldrburg, Eirgrab, and Niclarburg, not sar from cracow, on the
western bank os the Vistula, orat Igletes, Octauo, Schwarza, Zwil-
town, between Bohemia and Moravia), καὶ ὴ Λοῦνα ὕλη (Mentore).
Others place the Gothini on the south ol the Danube, where there

are several iron mines in styria ...... c. 4³

Gouowns. The name Gotones is synonymous with that os Γύθωνες
(Ptol), or Goths. They were frequently erroneously consounded
with the Getae and Soythians. Pytheas is the first who mentions
them, when they lived on the right bank oi the Vistula, and on the
coast os the Barna, on the borders oi Silesia and Poland, and alier-

ward a part os them in scandinavia, where their name appears in
