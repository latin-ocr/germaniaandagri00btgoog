msera etiam inspicitur. “lt lseveu seen by the Gauls on the

Nero, and a near friend oi Seneca, more so than was consistent Ι
with the unbiased statement of truth, which should characteriae the ·
historian. (Ana, xiii, 20.) He wrote the history os his own times.
Tacitus quotes him again in his history os Nero (xiv, 23 xv, 61).

sum is equivalent to io nniversam Britanniam. The whole clause is

,Sed immassant eamme, duc. “But an immense and boundless
extent os¹ land, and jutting out from that part where the coast now
