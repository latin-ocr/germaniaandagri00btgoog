‘⁶ To grean over fields, to labor upon dwellings,” i. a, to grean over

’ the plough, to lahor in the erectiori of dwellings. The verb illato-

rcrc is here formed after the model of ingemere. It nowhere else
appears in this meaning, since illaboratus, which does ocem, ha's
the signification of “not lahored,” “dene without lahor.”-Saas
dicamque fortunas, dre. “To keep their own tortunes and those
of others in a state οἰ constant disquiet through mingled hope aud

riehing or mining themselves and others in trade aud traffie.

Secari adrasus hmines. ‘⁴ Without care and anxiety as regards
men.” Observe thetmari, inthis and the following clause, must
not he rendered '‘saie’' Compare Agris, 9: ‘⁴ Cmtrensis jurisdic-
- tio secernet obtamorss’ dre, and ‘⁶ stastatuta& (Horat, ou, i.. xxvi„
8.)- Ut iltis ae soto quidm opas essa. “ That they would not need
even a wish.’' Rhenanus conjectured opas eit for opus earet, and
his emendation was adopted hy all subsequeut editors until the time
of Ernesti, who restored asset, without, however, assigning a very
satisfactory reason. The true reason is this: Tacitus does not
' mean to say that they laea no need even of a wish, as il statinga
fact3 but he gives merely the result of his own reflectione, namely,
that they would not need even a siah, if there were any thing to he
actually wished sor. compare the explanation os Walther: ‘¹ dm

Hellusios et Oxionas. Probably the inhabitants of Lapland. The
fahle here stated may possibly have arisen from their wearing the
skins oi wild hemis-Oxionas. Tacitus occasionally uses this
Greek ending, as in Helvaoonoe (ehap. xliii.); &ionae (chap. xlv.);
Vangionas ue Nemetas (Ana, xii.,27).-1n audiam relinquam. “I

will make a subject of doubt, and leave undeciled.” Ἰ Equivalent,
as Botticher eorrectly remarks, to ia dubium amalum relinquam ia
medio. The preposition ia, though joined here with the accusative,
’ includes at the same time the idea of the ablative, and the clause
may, therefore, be ranked under the head of a syllepsis. (Consult
. the remarks of Butticher on the style ol Tacitus, p. xliiof the pres-

ent volume.)
