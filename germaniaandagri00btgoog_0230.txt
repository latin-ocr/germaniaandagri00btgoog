sais agentern, dec. “Had destroyed almost to a man the troop os
horse acting within their contines.” The aba was the body of cav-
alry belonging to the legion, in number generally about three bun-
dred. Agamem marks that there was a rixed camp. The period
between the departure of Frontinus and the arrival os Agricola,
when the island was without a governor, probably afforded the op-
portunity sor this occurrence.

quue initio erecto provincio, dec. “And by this beginning the
inhabitants of the province being thrown into a state ol anxious sus·
pense, inasmucb as a war was what they wished for, either approved
ol the example, or waited to leam the leelings of the new govemor,”
i. e., or withheld their determination till they bad ascertained bis
feelings. The meaning is, that some did the one, and some the
other. Ut qai generally, and always in Livy, is joined with the
subjunctive mood; but sometimes with the indicative. Observa,
moreover, the imitation os tbe Greek idiom iu nt quibus bedam colea-
tibus erat, where the regular Latin form of expression would have
been ut qui bellum volebant, and compare Kiibaer, G. G, b 599, 3, ed.
Jelf. So we have iu Sallust (Jug, st), ‘⁸ Neque plebi munio osbati
putabatur,·” and (o. 100), “Uti militibus coequatus cam imperatore

υἰοιιίο militum, qoam etiam matriculam socam, sed pro ordinibus ipris
turmisque et cohortibus militum.” Walch rendere it here “the co·

rious subdivisions and bodies ol troops. Bbtticber, therefore, trans·

militem, dcc. ‘⁴ Inaction t'or that year was anticipated among tho

which delay and thwart one who purposes to commence wer.”
This must be taken as a parenthesis independent of quamquem.-
Goetodirieurpeeto. ‘⁴ Thu the suspected parts of tho countryshould

suspected os an intention to throw off the Roman yoke.
