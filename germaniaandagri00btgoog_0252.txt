enantion. “sunosio array (against you).”-Nunc. ‘⁴ As it is,
however,'’ i. c, aa matters, however, actually are-Furto noctis.
“Under the stealthy corering os tha night.”-Clunorc. “Bya
mere shout.‘’-li ceterorum Britannorum fugacissimi. “These, iu
respect os the rest ol the Britons, tha greatest fugitives os all.” Ob-
serva here the peculiar and apparently illogical construction os rste·
rorum with the superlative, and which we have endeavored to solt·
en down in translating. Itis, insact,an imitation os a Greek idiom.
Thus, we have in Thucydides (i., l), Ἀξιολογώτοτον τῶν προγεγενη-
μένον πολέμου. <Consult Poppo, ud loc, and Herm, ad Vig, p. 718.)

Quomodo silaus salumque penetrantibus, dcc. “As, when hunters
penetrate into woods aad thickets, each fieroest animal is laid low
ογ the strength, the timorous and wealr ones are put to ssight hythe
very noise os the band, so,” duo. The old reading was ruere, sor

which one ol the MSS. gives corum ruere, the word contra having

been written over the line by the copyist, evidently sor the purpose,
as Waloh remarks, os imparting some sense to ruere. This latter
reading is adopted ογ Erotion, the Bipont editor, Oberlin, Dronko,
Bekker, and others3 but the true lection, nevertbeless, is robore,
which the very opposition torono plainly indicates. Besides, the,
infinitivo ruere can not be used iu this way atter quomodo or sicut,-
while if we regard it, not as the infinitire, but the ud pl. ot* tha per·
sect (sor ruerunt), we ought theu to have the same tense, instead
os tho present, in pelluntur. According to tho reading which wo
have adopted, both roboreti. a.. agminis) and ipro sono aro construet-
ed with pelluntur, but there is a zeugma in the passage, and with
robore we must, in fact, understand such a verb as aditur. (Gom-
pare Wulcb, ud loc.)

Reliquus cst numerus, tro. “Thero remains only a number ot*
oowardly and timid mon, whom you bava found at last, not because
they opposed you, but because, being the last, they bave been ovor-
taken and caught by you.'' 'l'he expression qum quod tonum in-
venistis non restiterunt is an imitation os the Greek idiom, sor qui,
quod insanistis cor, non restiterunt. So “Urbem quam statuo uestra
est” (Virg, AEn.. i., 573), aud “Eunuchum quam dudini quus turbu.
trau’ (Ten, Eun, in, 3, ll).-In hir uestigiis. “ln this olaus
