Libertini nom multum supro seruos sumt. Among the Franks, the

freedmeu seldom attained to the full right os those who were sree-
boru. They could not inherit property, or give testimony against
free-born meu. Il a sreedman, moreover, died without children, his
property went to the treasury, as appears from the Ripuarian code.
(Tit, lvii, l. 4,) All the editions before that ol Ernesti have Liberti
here, lor which that editor correctly substituted Libertini, in accord-
auce with the strict distinction between the two terms. (Compare
Gir, in Verr, l, 47.) Walther‚ Dilthey, and others oppose the
change, but on very unsatisfactory grounds. The reference is not
to the freedmen os particular masters or familias, but to sreedmen
considered as a class. Hence the employment ol the term libertini
immediately aster (impares libertini), and which coufirms Ernesti’s
emendation.
- Raro aliquod momentum m domo. “They rarely possess any

are governed by kings.” Literally, “which are reigned over.”
Such, for example, were the Gotones, mentioued in chapter xliii,
and the Suiones in chapter xliv. Unto a Roman, after the experi-
ence ufforded by a Nero aud a Domitian, the terms monarchy and
despotism had become almost'synonymous.-·This employment os
regno in the passive voice departs from common usage, since in the
active voice it is used intransitively. Similar instances however,
occur in other parts oi Tacitus; as, sor example, in chapter xliii. os
the present treatise; in Amo, xiii, 543 andinllirt, i., to. So, also,
iu Pliny, H. N, vi, 23. (Compare Drakenborch, od Lim, i, 17, 3,
and Botticher, Les. Tac, p. 17.)

Ibi mim et super ingenuos, dac. Α state of things exaetly parallel
to this existed among the Romans during the reigns of some os thc
worst os their emperors, when the prideos the nobility was so much
lowered by the power and insolence to which freedmcn attaioed by
making themselves subserviant to the vices ol the prisce—Apud
ceteros impares libertini, &e “Among the rest, the subordinate con·
dition ol the freedmen is a proos of the value os freedom‚” ι’. ι.. the
lact that sreedmen are held iu such light estimation is a procl ol the
salue set upon sreedom and the rights os sreemen.
