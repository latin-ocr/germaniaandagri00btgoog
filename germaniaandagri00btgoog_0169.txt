CHAPTER XXX.

Ultra bns. Tacitus meane, beyond the tribes already mentioned
as dwelling on or near the Rhine; not those occupying the Decu-
mates agre-cnei initium redu, &e “The Catu make the first

rude beginning ol their settlements from the Hercynian Forest.”
Mannert refers this to a chain of the llarz Mountains, running north

from the Maia lor a considerable distance. (Grogr, vol. iii, p. 183.)
Observa the peculiar force ol the expression initium imbuant, which
is by no meane pleonastic, ns many suppose. The verb inchoare
strictly refers to the first slretcb or rude outline os any work, or to
the first rude commencement of any thing, and is here peculiarly
apposite. (Compare Cic, dc On, i., 2, b: ‘⁶ Qua adolescentulis nobie
acmmmrariolnnoseisimmaemdiaexadernmfl) The territory
ol the Gatti comprehended that ol tbe modern Hessians, Fulda, the
eerldems of Henen and lsenburg, so much cs Franconia as lies north
ol the Main, te the mouth ol the Scala, part ol Nassau, and the east·
ern portion of the Ducby os Westpbalia. (consult Geegraphieal
Index.) ·

scattered.” Observe tbe beautiful figure in durant, and compare

the remarks os Boettcher, Lex. Tac, p. 165. Passow, Hess, Diltbey, ·

and others place a colon alter durant, thus connecting it with what
precedes, and making civemn its subject, “ as the other states en·
dure to dwell in.” In tbe succeeding clause they read siquidm
codespnullatimrcrcscunt. This, however, issar inferior—Siquidem.
The positiones this word, as the second in the sentence, is in ac-
cordance with the habit of transposition in which Tacitus so lre·
queutly indulges, (Compare Wemikr, dc Elocutinne Taciti‚· and
Gerlach, ad loc.) The proper place os εἰςιιὶάιηι would be the first in
the sentence.

Et Cattos suos, &c ¹“And the Hercyniae Forest both escorts and
sets down its own Cetti.’' Abold and lively image. Whenamag·
