the Britons did not cover their bodies, and their huge swords were
not easily wielded at close quartus-Compitum urniorum ct in
octo pugnarn. ‘⁸ The thrusts of the nonan weapons, and a close

cominus et counradi: nranilrnr. Brotier understands it in the same
sense: Cmnplccus cat quod Galliac dicimus ¹⁸ ia melee,” cnm omninno
hostirpctitnm if, however, thia interpretation were correct, complexus
nannum would have the saure meaning as the following words, in
arcto pugno, that is, pagato comintu. But aa s'n arcto pugnem refers,
apparently, to manaa preceding (ot rem cd mucrones cc manua adduce-
rent), so conplexus may refer to mucrmuu and it will then merely
mean the blows or thmsts of the Roman weapons.-In arcto pug-
num. So, “ in arcto pagnn” (ltin, xxviii, 33). The old reading was
r'n aperto, which does not suit the meaning.

Equilum tornac sugere. We have given these words as they are
found in all the early editions. Lipsius, imagining that the Roman
cavalry were here meant, suspected the passage of being corrupt,
and conjectured equitnm tornac effudm ct orsinacii, duc, or, rather,
quitantiarum effuso cr scrinarii, duc. Ernesti prefers erupere to
sugere, thinking, with Lipsius, that the Romam are referred τος
while Walch supposes that an entire sentence hasbeen omitted,
which he attempta to supply. All this correction, however, is per·
fectly unnecessary. By equitum Tacitus means the cavalry of the
Britons, put to ssight hythe Romans, and the expression tanne,
which has misled so many commentatore, may bc applied to the
British as well as to the Mman horse. Thus Tacitus elsewhere
(Ana, xiv, 34) writes, ‘¹ Britannorum copie passim per catenas ct
tarmus euerritubant.”
