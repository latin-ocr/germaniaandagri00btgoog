Fenus agitare, dec. “To lend out money upon interest, and to
increase it by means of usurious practices, is unknown (among
them).” The expression in murae is a poetic one for neuris or per
maras. Commentators make a great difficulty with thie simplo
passage. Their various opinione may be scen stated by Weishaupt,
p. 379. One of the worst of these ie that advanced by Walther,
who makes scurehove here the meaning merely of “ capital,‘’ a
signification which, as Frennd correctly remarks, is extremely rare.
Tacitus is silently comparing German with Roman manners. At
Rome the most exorbitant usury was praetioso, whereas the Ger·
mane are here described as not only strangers to usurioue exactione,
but even to the leading out of money on interest at all.

Ideoque memorandae. “And, therefore, the abetaiuiug from
this practice is more effectually observed than if the practice itself
had been forbidden by law.” A remarkable instance of conciseness
inthe original, which can not be imitated in atronelation. The ref·
ereuce to what precedes is rather a mental thau agrammatical one,
. and we must, therefore, supply with ematur some such expression
ae abstinentiae fenore ogdoada On this usage of lauguage, consult
the remarks of Perizonius, adsonat. Minore, iv, 8, note v. Some .
commentatore give secatur here the meaning of “is provided
against‚’' “ie avoided,” without any ellipsie; but for this there ie
no authority-Lege vetitum esset. Usury was forbidden at Rome,
though in vain, by the lawe of the Twelve Tables, and by various
enactments made hy Licinius, Genucius, Sempronius, Julius Cesar,
¹and others. The Germane were free from it, on account of their
little acquaintance with moneyed transactione.

Agri, pro numero rebeum, dec. “The lande are occupied by
whole communities in turn, according to the number of persons to
till them.‘’ The true reading here is undoubtedly in vices, and the
meaning of the passage is, that the same territories were occupied
by different tribes or communities in turn, to a greater or lese ex·
tent, according to the number of persons to till them: The best
commentary on Tacitus here leto be found in the account given by
Cesar of the Suevi (Β. G, iv, 1). Some commentatore, however,

disregarding the authority of Cesar, read vicie for in vices, and think
that the Germane did not live in the manner of nomed tribes to suc‘

a degree as is commonly supposed; but that individuale had pos·
sessione of their own, which they retained, without any os the ex·
