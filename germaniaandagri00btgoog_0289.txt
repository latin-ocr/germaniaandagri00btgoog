Farsh. A German tribe, divided into the Frisii majores and mi·

nores. Tha Frisii minum inhahited the tract north ns tha Insula ·

Batavorum, comprising Oberyeael, Golden, Utrecht, and the greater
part os the province oi Helland. The Frisii moyam dwelt between
the Yssel, the Eme, and the country of the Bructeri in West Fries-
lund and Griningen. The Frisiahones, mentioned by Pliny, probably
formed a part oi the sarna racc, and seem to have dweltin the islanda
of the Zuyder Zea. From their first acquaintance with the Romans,
they long continued their most zealous friends in this part: they
rendered Drusus the most active service; and not only supported
Germanicus themselves, hy their advice and service, but bought
over the Cauci also. The cause os this friendship is, probably, to
ha found in the hostility which existed between them and the Che·
rusci, against whom all these enterprises ns the Romans were di·
rected. It was interrupted, however, in consequence os the Ro-
, mans building forts in their territorias, and attempting to levy tribute.
They rose upon the Romans, massacred the soldiers who were
among them, and destroyed moetos their strong-holds. Corbulo,
the Roman general, proceeded against them3 but the yealousy of

Claudius Cesar stopped his conquesta and he was obliged to with· ·

draw to the let‘t bank os the Rhine. From this time sorward the ’
Romans no more entered their country. In the fourth and fisth ceu·
turies we hear of them as members os the Saxon league; aud by
this time they had greatly extended their possessione. On the east,
they reached to the Wesrr, and along the coast they held some posta
as sar as the Elia, on the west, their name appears more than once
ln the Batavian island, on the Messe and Scheldt, and on the whole
coast os Plaudere. They accompanied the Saxone in therr invasion
