xlvi on rau erras or sacrans.

b. Words which are commonly called srrorruous, but which, in
truth‚ are of such a natine that the one augmenta, explains, and m.
plilies with a new sense the signification ci the other. Generally,

substantives, cl' which Tacitus is very fond, are constructed in this
manner: seditio et turbe, salgcr ed claritudo, dolor et ἕνα, odiant et s'e·
vidia, mcdcctt'a et pudor, sanguia ct cades, circs ct rebar. Veteres tt
scats, antiqui ac ceteras, do not so much belong tc this head, as they
do not express the same things of adjectives, adverbs‚ and verbs so
used, the number is less. The following are exemplos: decenam ct
ambiguam, immotam ficumque, turbide et seditiose temere ac samia,
caelare ct abdere, pollaifadars'pae.

c. 'l'he figure called in Greek lv διὰ δυοῖν (Hendiadys), ol which
we have an example in the well-known passage, pateris libamus cl
aare. But the examples os this ligure which are found in Tacitus
(and they are very many) prove that there is a greater power iu sub·
stantives aud adjectivae. constructed aster this manner, than in the
usual form of speech: Aga, 16, nec allam ic barbaris acedia genes
maisit ira et cictcfia (this has greater force than irc eictcrm it is
anger and the license os victory, rather than os the conquamrs);
Germ„ 33, caper sexaginta aila-oblectarem· oculisque cecidemat <nat
simply oblectationi mmm, but sor our entertainment and the mere
pleesnre of the spectacla). The copulative conjuncticn often serres
i'or an explanation: decad, i., to, incedebat muliebre et miserabile
agmen (not ηιὶιεναόίίε muleram agmen, but a trocp consisting of
women, and for that reason chiefly miserable).

d. As to the examples oi discnssit, they proceeded less from the
genius of Tacitus than from the common usage ol' the Latin language,
nor dc they detract in any measure from the brevity os the discourse3
since none of the old writers has given offence by thus, aa it wera,
expressing things abundantly. But there are also many among them
passages cf such a kind that the oue word adds something to the
meaning cs the other. Thus, mare Oceanum is spoken of just as
Rhenes amant carptas in all writers (contrary to the usage of our
language) is used pleonastically in such passages, corporis morbac,
comm-ram celera, libera capara (liberi homines): arete precidere, ante
predicere are also used in the older writers; ipse solae, Gerra, 38,
and Dia„ 5, aud salac et ranas, Diua, 34, are explained hy referring
to the Greek αὐτὸς μόνος, and also to that passage ol Cicero, Vama
2 (qnod ipsis solis eatis esset).
