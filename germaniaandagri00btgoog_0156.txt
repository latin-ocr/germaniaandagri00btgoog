regular gnests is marked by easy affability.'’ Alter describing the
general hospitality oi the Germane, and their reception os mere
strangers, Tacitus here speaks os their mode os receiving and en·
tertaining regularly-invited guests, or, in other words, those con·
nectedwiththembythetiesolhospitality. (Walttemdloc.) Some
editors look upon this sentence as a mere gloss, or marginal note,
which has got inserted into the text. Others consider cornis as
arising from a eontracted mode os writing commosis in the MSS.

Others take cornis to mean, “without any suspicion of deceit or ’τ’

treachery.‘’ Just as cognitor is equivalent to siaa dolo mala The
explanation of Walther, however, as given above, removes avers Δ·
difficulty. ·'

Quem plerumque in diem, duc. Compare chap. xv. : “ Dediti som·

note on obligantur in previous chapter-Pterimom. “During the
greatest part of the year.” Supply temporis-Saporem singolis
sedes, dne. Eating at separate tables is generally an indication of
voracity. Traces os it occur, also, in the Homeric poema.

Diem noctemque castinum, dne. “ To keep drinking day and night,
without intermission, is disgraceful to no one.” More literally, “ to
make day and night continuone by drinking.” The love os drinking
was common to the Germane, with their stem-relatives, the Per·
stans. (ComparsXeo, Cyrop.,viii., 8.)-Utinter vinolentos. “As
is natural among a people addicted to drink.” Rhenanus conjec-
tures violentos, because the Germane were without any wine! But
consult the commencement ol the succeeding chapter.

Sed et &reconciliandis &c Herodotus relates the same thingof

Gens non astato, nec callida, doc. “This nation, neither acute nor
cmliv, still disclnse the secrets of their brcasts amid the freedom
of festivity.” Observe here the force ol adhoc, as rightly explained
by Passow Tacitus is again contrasting the Germane with the
Romans, from ‘the latter os whom the former, according to him.
