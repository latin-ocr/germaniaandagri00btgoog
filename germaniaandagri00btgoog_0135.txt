-Admirutione prowm. “They take the lead by reason of the ad·
miratron which they inspirc.'‘-Animodsertere. “To put to death.”
This verb commonly means “to puuish” simply, here, however,
it is to be taken in a stronger sense, as in Hist, i, 46, and iv., 49,
aud wc may supply gladio or something similar. Tacitus, it will
' be perceived, is descending from heavier to lighter punishments.-

Vincire. Bonds would bc something yet more offensive tc freemen
than stupes-Nisi sandotibus permissum. The statement of Tac-
itus is at varianee with that cf Cesar, who remarks (B. G, vi, 23),
‘⁸ Qum bellurn urnas aut illatum defendit, nutinsert, magistratus, qui
ei bello prosint, ut site necisque habeant potestatem deliguntur.” Lip-
sius seeks to reconcile these two authorities by supposing that
Tacitus refers to a state of peace, hut Cesar to ono of war. He is
· plainly contradicted, however, by what follows. '

Non quasa in punam, dno. What was thus inflicted by the priests
was not regarded in the light of a mere judicial sentence, nor as
emanating from the dux, or military leader, butas something coming
from on high-Sed velut deo imperante, dic. The god Tbor, the
German Mars, is meant. (Compare chapter ix.)

. Effigiesque et signa quedam, &e “ (On this account), moreover,
they carry to battle efligies (of animale), and certain standards taken
, down from their (sacred) groves,” i. e., in consequence of this belief
that the godis present in the battle-field, they bear to battle the
effigies of auimals answering the purposes of standands, which, from
the circumstance of their having been preserved in sacred groves,
will, it is conceived, propitiare the favor of the divinity, and induce
him to beon their side. With effigies, supply serarum, an ellipsis
supplied elsewhere by Tacitus himself, Hist, iv, 22: “ Deprmnts
silvis imisque serarum imagines.” The expression effigies et signa
wedam, moreover, means nothing more than ‘⁴ effigies forming or
answering the purpose of a kind of standands,” the conjunction et
being hero merely explanatory, and the standands referred to being
like those represented on the columns of Trajan and Antoninus,
namely, the figure of an animal at the top of a pole. (Diltbey, ad
loc—Gerlach, ad loa—Klenrm, Germ. Altertiumslr, p. 231.) ,

Turnum aut minum. “The troop of horse, or the wedge of foot.”
Among the Romans a turnus contained thirty men, here,- however,

the word is used ina general sense-Familia et propinquitates. .

“Families and kindreds.'' Eichhorn appears to be in error when
he thinks that these bore more analogy to the Roman gentes than
to relationship of blood or wedlock. t (Stante und Rechts Gessit, ἰ.,1
