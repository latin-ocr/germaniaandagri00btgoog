in whose territory Suetonius was posted; and, accordingly, we
must look ιο the northern tribes above the Iceni. The wide extent
oi the Brigantes, the loose connectiones some of the tribes witb
their queen, Cartismandua, and their fondness sor warlilre adven·
ture, which is marked by their very name (Brigands), render it not
nnlikely that some ol the southern divisione ol this racc took part
in the insurrectiones their neighbors. Why, moreover, should
Calgacus mention the remote and comparatively small tribe os the
Trinobantes, rather than the neighboring and powersul ons of tlte
Brigantesl (Compare Ann, xii, 32.)
