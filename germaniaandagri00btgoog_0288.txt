us, &c It is a curious confirmation, in part, at least, os this hy·
pothesis, that the Ossetes‚ a Caucasian tribe, have the word Dan in
their language as a general term sor ·‘water,” “river,” dec, and
designate all mountain streams by this appellation. (Compare
Lehrberg, Uutersuclruugen, dcc, Paterae, p. 400, and Ritter, Varkana,
paon. . . . . . . . .c.1,ae,41,42

Dscuuirus Acar. A name applied to lands conquered by the
Romans, iu which, sor the sake os security, that uo hostile tribe
might dwell close to their borders, they allowed Gauls or Roman
soldiers to settle, who were charged with the payment os a tithe
(melma) to the Romans. The Romans very commonly exacted a
tithe from those who occupied the public lande: the greater partos
Sicily was taxed in this way. (Compare Anu, xiii, 5t; Coa, Β.
G, vi, 23.) The situation oi these lands is variously laid down.
Some authors place them on the banks os the Nedum others be
tween the Luhu and the Malu,- and on the banks os the Danube,
opposite the province of Retia ; or within the Roman vallum, reach-
iug from Mogontiacum to the Danube, near the source os which lay
the territories oi the Marcomanni, which the Romans toolr posses
aion of alter Maroboduus removed to Bohemia. Drusus Germani
cus, having built a sort on Mount Taunus, seems to have laid the
iirst foundation of the limes inclusing the Decumates agri, which
was gradually advanced, especially by Trajan and Hadrian, and for-
tified. Though the occupatiou of these lands depended on the will
os the emperors, towns gradually sprung up in thern. There are
still remains oi a Roman wall running srom Iugolstada on the Dan·
ube, past Diukelrbubl and OEhringeu, to the Maia. ‘Toward the end
os the third century these lands were wrested frorn the Romans by
the Alemanni, whom Julian aud Valentiniau in vain endeavored to
erpel ........... c. 29

Dunoraim. A German tribe, called Δουλγούμνιοι by Ptolemy,
who places them ou the eastern bank of the Weser, in the southern
part ot* Guleubcrg, and thewestern hals os Grubeubagcu. But this
was not the position in which Tacitus knew them. He places them
in the rear os the Chamavi and Angrivarii, in what was once the
territory oi the Bructeri; and their territories, according to thie,
would lie between the Erus and the Lippa, where the town of Dul-
gibiuum (Duluuu) was situated. They belonged to the Cherusci,
and were apparently driven eastward by the sarne eruption ot the
Carrei as that which expelled the Angrivarii. (Ptol, ii, ll ; Strab,

vii.,44) . . . . . . . . „motii
