and incerere, the infinitiva is joined in the place ofa genitive or of
the particle queis renat, ii, 2⁷, Libo Drurus desertw moliri res

ueram· iii, 38, reque mirus Rlemetalcerdreusars popularium iss·
jurias inultas rinere (compare below, On Gnncrsus). On the other
hand, quod and ut are sometimes employed in amore unusual mau- ,
ner for the accusative with the infinitive: creditum quod-veluisretf
prebere jruserat rut-resisterent. See above, d., neer the end.

g. The mercurive is often, even in the obliqua oratic, joined to
the particle dum ea Arnai, ii, 81, Piso orarit uti traditis umis
maneret irs castello, dum Gerar cui Syriam permitteret consulitur.
Former writers heve seldom spoken thus; aud so, in general, the iu·
dicative is found more frequently in Tacitus than in other historicel
writers, when sentences are inserted in the oblique oratio as if they
proceeded from the mind of the writer himself; ae, Hist, iv., 16, ss
eum cotom, eui preerat-tumultum compressurum. No one, more·
over, has oftener used the indicative for the subjunctive, in that kind
of sentences which indicate that that which is implied in the condi·
tion had almost happened, es we have itin Livy, who not unfre-
quently speaks thus: iii.. 19, runc risi Latini-arma armicol-
deleti eranam, we were lost. Generally risi, more rarely si, joined
with the pluperfect, and sometimes with the imperfect, begins the
condition, end the idea which is limited by it oflener precedes theu
follows in the imperfect, the pluperfect, and sometimes the perfect:

Her, i., 64, prope in prelium exarsere, ni Veiens-admonuisset (thus
Livy, ii, 10, pons iter pene hortibus dedit, ri unus vir suieset). In·
stauces conformed to the common usage cf the lnnguege are less fre·
quent in Tacitus.

To the seme cleas belongs the Euareten or rna Iurnnrncr rou

fortuna, neque tua gloria inclaruerat. Compare Hist, i., 48, Pise
