tilius, in addition to a biography 01 himself, composed a hrstory and
some orations. He was lieutenant to Q. Metellus Numidicus,
hue. 645. He was accused 01 bribery by Scaurus, was unjustly
condemned, and went into exile at Smyrna, of which place he be-

came a citizen, and refused to return at the invitation of Sylla. M
AEmilius Scaurus was consul with M. Care. Metellus in A.U.C. 6³9,

and again in 647, and censor in 645. He was one of the commis·

sioners sent into Africa in the iugurthino war, and suffered himselt ·

to be corrupted by Jugurtha: He was aviolent opposer of Saturni·
nus; and was charged by Varius with having been instrumental in

v exciting the revolt of the Italian allies, hut was acquitted. (Cio,
Brut, 293 Plio, xxxiii, 6.) It is not unlikely that Rutilius, iu his
voluutary exile, wrote his own life as a defenoe 01 his conduct, aad

that this iuduced Scaurus to write a biography of himself
Adeo. “So true it is that.'¹ Literally, “to such a degree.”

At mili, nuuc mnaturo, dcc. Though, under Nerva, liberty had

again dawned upon Rome, and men’s courage had begun to revive,
Tacitus had still to fear the malicious accusatione of many, who

would imagine that, iri portraying the crimes 01 the past age, a side
reference was made totheir own; and, therefore, at the commence-
ment 01 his memoir he asks for security against ali charges of this
kind. This passage may he illustrated from the Annals (iv, ³3).-
Ni euremarus temporo. ‘y‘ Were I not about to traversa times.” A
metaphor horrowed from the monomenta 01 the circus. Some of
the early editions read ai incunctatus, from which lipsius conjeo-
tured ni immaurus, and this latter reading hasbeen adopted hy
several subsequent editors. No change, however, is required in the
common text. ¹

Legimus, oum Aruleno Rustico, doc. Both occurrences took place
in Domitian’s reign, A.U.c. 84601 847. Tacitus was present at
the death of Senecione we learn from chapter xlv. The reference
