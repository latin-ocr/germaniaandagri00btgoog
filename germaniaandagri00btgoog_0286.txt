Cinaei. The accounts os the ancients respecting the seats os the
Cimbri, or Cimmerii, abeund in uncertainties and contradictione.
Strabo places them on the ocean, hy the nice, Mela, in the islands
os the Baltic; Pliny, to the east os the Elhe, and on the peninsula
which took its name from them; Tacitus places them in the same
quarter; Ptolerny, at the extremity os the Cimbric Chersoneso.
But, upon examination, it does not appear that they ever inhabited
these parts. The Greeks first became acquainted with thern on the
northern coaetos the Pontus Euxinus. They were driven from this
quarter, and disappeared from the knowledge of the Greeks, who
sahled that they dwelt on the shores os the Northern Ocenn, ina
land shrouded in perpetual night. Pytheas, who circumnavigated
the greater part os the northwest of Europe, saw a large peninsula,
where the long nights and intense cold in winter seemed to accord
with the poetical descriptione os the land of the Cimmerii, and so
assigned this country as their abode. In this he was followedby
most οἰ the ancient geographere: Strabo sets them down as one
os the tribes with which they were hest acquainted; although in the

next sentence he aclrnowledges that all beyond the Elhe was totally
unknown ιο nie Greeks (vn, p. ττι, au. cn.. 294). wo mention
is made os the Cimbri in the expeditione οἰ Drusus and Germani-
cus; and though the fleet os the latter discovered the Cimbric Cher-
sonese of Pytheas, they sound nc Cimbrians dwelling in it, nor did
it bear a name derived from that people. Ptolemy places thern at

the extremity os it, merely to fill up a gap, as he has no other tribe
to fix in this locality. Their real country lay, prohahly, on the north·
east side of Germany: it was on this side that they invaded Ger-
many, and were opposed hy the Boii, at that time the inhabitants of
Bobemia. Bolon( τὸν Ἑρκύνιον δρυμὸν οἰκεῖν. Τοὺς δὲ Κίμόρους ὁρ-

the Teutones they entered Gaul, where they were joined hy the
Ambrones. With their combined forces they then invaded Spain,
but were repulsed hy the Celtiberi. The Teutones and Ambrones
then made an irruption into Italy, where they were defeated hy Ma-
rius (BG. loa). A part of the Cimbri, who had gone into Helvetia,
were there joined hy the Tigurini ; these made another attach upon
Italy, and defeated Catulus ; hut were at last ronted hy Marius (3.0.
101). The remnant of them is said to have settled in Helvetia
