cept the foreign government.-0ccultiae. “ Somewhat distautly.‘’
-ln approbanda excusatione. “ ln making good his excuse (to the
emperor),’' i. e,- his excuse sor not accepting the proconsulare.
(Compare, as regards the force of approbanda, the notes on chap. v.)
-Noo jam obscuri. This is a correction sor aon tom macari, and
answers infinitely better to primo occultius. Resides, ito, not tom,
would be required.

Paratus simulatione. So “paratos peditotu” (cic, od Aet, ix, 1³).
-ln arrogantiam compositus. “Having assumed astately air.”-
Agi sili gratias possm est. Obllging persons to return thanks for

Cosa, lii, 233 lxxviii, 22.)-Ne quod coluerat videretur emisse.
‘⁶ Lest he might seem to have purchased what he had lorbidden,” i.

his authority.

Proprium hnmani aragonii est. ‘⁶ It isa principle oshumau nature.”
As regards the sentiment expressod hythe clause, compare Seneca
