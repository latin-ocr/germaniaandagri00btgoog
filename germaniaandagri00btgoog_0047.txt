3, incusabatur facile toleraturus cecilium delecta Lesbo (quod faat'b
toleraturus esset): Hier„ it, 74, cetam-agiam mrum spernam

(sperabantur fore nt sequerentur). The perfect passive participle is
nsed br the finite tenses of tha verb: Ausul„ vi., 82, capitas· d
Tiberio, ι’. ι, cupiebat3 and so it takes the place of a substantive (as
in Plantns); Amal.. iv„ 3, nepotes adelti moraes capita adsum

The neuter of the future passive participle is joined with the val)
tatere, alter the manner of the Silver Age (like the perfect participle,
mam te mea, and es we read in Cicero, eden am balma
hermam, reepoadendam, nabendum babae.

β. Οῆοηοτ, and still more boldly than other writers, he uses the
perfect passive participle in the place of aa abstract substantive,
when it refers even tn inanimato objecta: Amat, i.‚ 8, cen occisas
dictator Cesar-pulcherrimam saciant viderem,- Annal„ vi„ 27,
geras s'lls' decoram, vivida aenectm et noa permissa provincia digu-
tionem addiderat. Compare Livy, xxvii„ 37, liberatas religione msa
turbarit rursus emtarum, Frusinone infantem natum esse quatu

ciples3 in the seme way adjectivae which indicate a cortun ense aad
perpetuity are expressed by futore active participles. and others, also,
by future passive participles: Agr„ 18, nibil arduam aad hanan
credere (so Sallust); Amal„ i., 28, noctem minacem et in aceles ertp-
taram sors lenio& in, 38, pulcherrima effigies et manem (lasting,
enduring); Dian, 22,firmat sanc partes et duraturum Annae„ ii„ 38
(so Livy, the poeta, end the writers of the Silver Age), quam
domm Hermaia· pudendam ad inopiam delaberetur (fredam, turpem
but it is easily perceived that the participle ismore forcible); Hist..
iii.. 84, pudenda latebra sanet aculam.

δ. Ablatives which are called absolute ere used in an unusual way,
and generally elliptically; but exemplos of the seme thing are not
wanting in the older writers. The most nnccmmon case is that of
the hture active participle employed in thie way: Hiar„ ii.‚ 32, in·
rupturis tam infestinationibus. Very often the participle of the sub-
stantive verb (ὤν) must be supplied, as it were, in thought, when a 1
substantive iafonnd (pat absolutely) joined with an adjective or with
a pmnonn: Hire, iii„ 26, incipere oppugnationem-arduam, ct nullo
juata marato ωηερε, Arnai, xi„ 23, affecisse olim indigenae coa·
anguineis papalia that is, when yet the natione of Italy were of the
same racc es the Romanu Livy, xxxvi„ 6, labante-disciplina et
maumam eo stata, qai diuturnas esse non posset. The ellipsis is
harsher when the adjective or substantive is used alone in this man·
