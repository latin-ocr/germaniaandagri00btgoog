mahtais mutatis rabaudus. Observe that quamuis is here for quam·
paam, a usage occurring only in the later prose writers. (Gruter,
adice.)

Sed utrum Aravisci, dac. Tacitus here calls the Osi a German
notion, whereas in chapter xliii. he remarks, that their use os the
Pannonian tongue proves them to be not Germane. Some editors
think that in the present passage their settlements only are referred
to, but the contradiction is too manifest to be remedied in this way.
Passow regards Germanorum natione as an interpolation, which is, ,
probably, the true opinion, though rejected by Walther and others.
-Eadem mriusquc ripa bona malaque want. ‘⁶ There were the same
advantages and disadvantages on both sides of tho stream,” i. a,
there was the same freedom and the same poverty. The river
meant is the Danube.

selves from all resemblance unto, as well as from the indolence that ·

the Gaulo, whom they resemble in person and in indolence. Ob-

Ubii quidem, dac. The Ubii were the allies os Oaesar against the
Suevi, and were afterward transportcd to the lest bank os the Rhine
by Agrippa (Be. 38). By origine is meant their German origin,
before they became a colony ; since it was hardly likely that a people
who had been made a colony os by the Romans, and placed in a post

os trust, as Tacitus says, ut arcerent, non ut custodirentur, should
blush sor this bonor. Some commentators, however, have referred
origine to Agrippina. (Consult Lipsius, ad loc.)

Gordianis sui nornine. We have no direct evidence as to who
founded the colony in question. The town (now Cologne) was
called Colonia Agrippina, or Agrippinensis, the first os which names
would mean, “ the Oolony os Agrippa,'’ and the second, ⁴⁸ the colony
