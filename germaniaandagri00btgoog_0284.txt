were friends os the Romans in the expedition ol Drusus, and still

more so in that os Tiberius (Ana, i.‚ 60 ; ii, 17). Even alter the '

disaster os Varus, they continued their friendship, and Germanicus
made all his expeditione against the Cherusci lrom this side.v But
here, again, the Romans roused the eumity oi their allies, hy pur-
suing the same policy as in the case oi the Frisii. Under Gannas-
cus, they crossed the Rhine‚ and ‘made incursione on the Roman
province ¹osGermania Inferior (Ana, xi„ 13); but were repulsed hy
Corbulo. They afterwaru aided Civilis in the Batavian war (Hist,
iv, 79 ; v., 19). Even alter the expulsion os the Romam, they con-
tinued the euemies ol the Cherusci, and lelt themselves powerful
enough to drive this pcople from the west bank os the Weser, while
they ejected the Ansibarii (Ana, xiii, 55), and perhaps some more
southerly branches os the Cherusci, from their possessione along the
Weser, and it is only aster this that the remark ol Tacitus applies
to them, that the southern angle os their territory hordered ou one
side on the Cherusci, and on the other on the catti. But the Lan·
gobardi‚ pressing westward to the Rhine‚ established themselves in
all the lands which had belonged to the Cherusci and their alhes;
and in the timens Ptolemy the Cauci were reduced within their
original boundaries. Ptolemy (ii, 11) mentions, as their towns,
Φαόίρανον (Brome, or Varel),1letioava (diusburg, Loucnburg, Bux-
tehuda, or astartem), Τεκέλια (Oldenhroolt, Elsfletb, or Zetcl), Tov-
λίφρουρὸον (Vardo, or Driltlbcrgen), Σιατουτάνδα (Utendc), Τευδέριον
(Deteret). Their name is still preserved in that oi their harhor, Gus-
buoen. (Compare Munnert, 111, p. 275, sopp). . .o. 35, 36

Carulvr. A German tribe, who originally occupied the tract
which extended northward to the Vecb, eastward to the Ems, south-
ward to the Lippa, and westward to the eastern mouth os the Rhine.
At a later period they lived between the Weser and the Harz Moust-
ains, in Eichseld, and a partos Grubenhagcn and Hohenstein. In the
third century they are again found on the libiae, as members of
the Frank league; and in the next century they spread themselves
along the Waul. Tacitus has most probably committed a mistake
in placing them in the country ol the Bructeri. (Compare Manum,
iii, p. 151) ......... c. 33, 34

Cursum. A German tribe, whose settlements ars placed by
Ptolemy ou the western side os the er, between the Haase aud
the sources of the Lippa, in osnaburg and Padarborn. They were
atribe oi the Cherusci; and afterward appear among the Franks,
on the western partos the Lower Rhine, in the dukedom ol Golden.
They were conquered hy Tiberius and Germanicus. (Veli. Patere,
11 , 118; Mannert, iit, p. 179) ...... c. st
