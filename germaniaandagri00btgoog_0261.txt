Tradiderat interim Agricola, dac. Dio Cassius (liii, 15) mentions
su ordinance os Augtrstus, directing that, wbeuever a successor ar-
rived, the previous governor should immediately resign his authority,
aud return homa within three months atter this. The successor
of Agricola was probably Sallustius Lucullus, who, as Suetonius iu-
forms us, was put to death by Domitian sor permitting certain lan-
oes or a new construction to be called Lucubrare. (Suet, Dora, 10.)
The possessiones the Highlands was lost aiter Agricola was re-
called. (Compare Hiat, i., ay-Ae, ru maltis celebritate, dte.
“And lest bis entrance into the city might be too conspicuous,
through the rank aud numbers oi those going out to meet him.'’
We must not, as some do, make celebritate aud frequentia synony-
mous. Tbe two terms are quite distinct, the former referring to
rank, the latter to number. (compare Bbtticher: “dureb Glareaad
Mercgeder Erttgegenkomraertdert ;’' and consult Lea. Tac, s. ath—Ami-
earam fficio. “The salutationes his friends.” (Compare Cic. pra
Marcia, 38, and Ernesti, Clas. cte, e. a. Officium.)

was wcnt to receive with a kiss the more distinguished of those who
sought au audience with him. This, however, soon became the
irene osculare, or slight ceremouious salutatico, amounting toa mere
matter os iorm3 and in some cases, even, it was not given. (Con-
sult Suet, orl, 6; Ner, ³73 Dora, 12; Dio Cass, lix, 30;
Schwartz, ad Ptin, Pcneg, 24, 2, &c.)-Turba emnium. “With

meant the mere men oi peace, ii we may so expressit, or, in other
words, mere civiliaus.-Trcrrqaillitatem atque otiam penitus aucit.
‘⁶ He gave himself up entirely to tranquillity and ease.” Peaitar is
here equivalent to prorem, maino, calm. (Compare Gis, Off.. ii,
