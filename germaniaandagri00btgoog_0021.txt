work oi Taclms lt has been sometimes doubted is itia by Tacitus,
bnt the style is in favor oi the common opinion, though it proseuta in
many respecta a marked contrast to the ‘Ananis’ the work oi bis
mamre years. Messala, one os the speakers, attributes the decline
ot* oratory to the neglectos the orduone method ot* study adopted by
the older oratore, who learned their art by attaching themselves to
some eminent speaker, and by experience in the acmsl business oi
lifes in Mersals’s time, the school of the rhetoricirms was the only
place ot* discipline ior the young. But Maternus, mother speaker,
indicates mora truly the canam os the decline ot* eloquance, ny a rei·
erence to the political condition ot* the Romans, aad the suppression
os their energias under the empira, as compared with tlre mrbulent
activityoi thehepublican period. ,
“ The ⁶ Annals' oi Tacitus are the work of his riper age, on which
his historical reputetion mainly rests. Thongb entitled Annals, and
ln general sufficiently true to the chronological order ot* events, the
title oi Annals conveys no exact nonen os the characteres this work.
The writer moulded the matter ci his history, and adopted it to his
purpose, which was not acomplete enumeration oi the domestic aad

with the notion of the government ot* one man. The power thathad
been founded and consolidated by Augustus had been transmitted
through many princes, few of whom bod distinguished themselves
by ability, and some hod sullied the purple with the most abominabis
crimes. Yet the imperial power was never shaken aiter it was once
firmly established, ’and the restoration ol the old Republio was never
senously contemplated by any sober thinlrer. The necessity of the
imperial power was felt, and the historica, while he describes the
vices and sullies οἰ those who had held it, and often casts a glauce
of regret toward the Republican period, never betrays a suspicion
that this power could be replaced by any other, in the object and
fallen state oi the Roman people. Itis this conviction which gives
to the historicel writings os Tacitus that dramatic character which
pervades tho whole, and is seen in the selection of eventa, and the
mode in which they are presented to the render. Itis consistent

with this that the bare saon, es they may be extracted from bis ner·
native, are true, and that tbe coloring with which be has heightened
them may osten be falae. This coloring was his mode os viewing
tlre progress ol events, and the development ct* the imperial power:
